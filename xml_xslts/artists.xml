					<summary>Amnesiac is the fifth studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. It was
                        released on 4 June 2001 in the United Kingdom and on 5 June 2001 in the United States and
                        Canada, debuting at #1 on the UK charts and #2 on the
                        Billboard Top 200. Seen as the furthest departure yet from the rock style and heart-on-sleeve
                        songwriting of the band's early career, Amnesiac nevertheless has more audible guitar than
                        its direct predecessor Kid A, and unlike that album, it spun
                        off several singles. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Amnesiac"&gt;Read

                        off several singles. Like Kid A, it synthesizes influences of electronic music, ambient music,
                        classical music, and jazz.

                        released on 9 June 2003 in the United Kingdom and 10 June 2003, in
                        the United States. It debuted at number one in the UK and at number three in the United States.

After
                        two Radiohead albums that featured heavily processed vocals, less guitar, and strong influence
                        from experimental electronica and jazz, Hail
                        to the Thief was seen as a return to alternative rock, drawing its sound from every era of the
                        band's existence. Preceded by the single "There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere.)",
                        the album reached number one on the UK charts, and met
                        with modest but worldwide commercial success, selling 994,000 units in the United States.

Band
                        members described the album as having a more "swaggering" sound and a relaxed
                        recording process, in contrast to the tense Kid A and
                        Amnesiac sessions. At nearly an hour in length, Hail to the Thief is the band's longest
                        album, although many of its songs are within the three- and even two-minute range, shorter than
                        the band's average. Thom Yorke said he was inspired by
                        Beatles songs of that length which he thought felt much longer. This album has been released
                        with the Copy Control protection system in some regions.

The album received universal
                        acclaim from professional critics upon release, based on a
                        Metacritic score of 85/100, or 85%. Neil McCormick, writing in The Daily Telegraph, called it
                        "Radiohead firing on all cylinders, a major work by major artists at the height of their
                        powers", and the record performed typically well in
                        magazines' end-of-year lists, especially in the United States. It was the fifth straight
                        Radiohead release to be nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Album. Unswayed, the NME's
                        James Oldham saw it as "a good rather than great
                        record" and Alexis Petridis of The Guardian called it "neither startlingly different
                        and fresh nor packed with the sort of anthemic songs that once made them the world's
                        biggest band." In 2004, coproducer Nigel Godrich and
                        engineer Darrell Thorp were honoured with Grammy Awards for their work on Hail to the Thief.

Like
                        the album itself, every song on the album has two titles. The intended titling for the album is
                        as follows:

1. 2 + 2 = 5. (The
                        Lukewarm.) - 3:19
2. Sit Down. Stand Up. (Snakes &amp; Ladders.) - 4:20
3. Sail to the
                        Moon. (Brush the Cobwebs out of the Sky.) - 4:18
4. Backdrifts. (Honeymoon Is Over.) - 5:23
5.
                        Go to Sleep. (Little Man Being Erased.) -
                        3:22
6. Where I End and You Begin. (The Sky Is Falling In.) - 4:29
7. We Suck Young
                        Blood. (Your Time Is Up.) - 4:57
8. The Gloaming. (Softly Open Our Mouths in the Cold.) -
                        3:32
9. There There. (The Boney King of Nowhere.) -
                        5:24
10. I Will. (No Man's Land.) - 1:59
11. A Punchup at a Wedding. (No no no no
                        no no no no.) - 4:57
12. Myxomatosis. (Judge, Jury &amp; Executioner.) - 3:53
13.
                        Scatterbrain. (As Dead as Leaves.) - 3:22
14. A Wolf at the
                        Door. (It Girl. Rag Doll.) - 3:21

However, due to a misprint in the album artwork,
                        there was no period after the "5" in "2 + 2 = 5". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Hail+to+the+Thief"&gt;Read

					<content>In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. It
                        was first released on 10 October 2007 as a digital download that customers could order for
                        whatever price they saw fit, followed by a standard CD
                        release in most countries during the last week of 2007. The album was released in North America
                        on 1 January 2008. In Rainbows was Radiohead's first release after the end of their
                        contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio
                        albums in their career.

In Rainbows was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire and
                        Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more
                        than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between
                        recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a
                        wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic
                        music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing
                        their focus on guitars, drums and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was
                        more personal than that of Radiohead's other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as
                        his attempt to write "seduction songs".


                        Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the
                        U.S. Billboard 200 at number one. In Rainbows also earned widespread critical acclaim, and
                        several publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2007.

					<content>Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October
                        2000 by Parlophone. On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK
                        Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical
                        change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the
                        ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments, incorporating influences from genres
                        such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century
                        classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris,
                        Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20
                        tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album,
                        Amnesiac, released the following year.

Radiohead released no singles or music videos to
                        promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first
                        major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The
                        album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music
                        and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album
                        was leaked before release.

Kid A debuted at the top
                        of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead's
                        first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best
                        Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its
                        departure from Radiohead's earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later
                        attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times
                        ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012,
                        Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &lt;a

					<content>OK Computer is the third album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1997. It
                        reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead's highest entry into the American
                        market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer
                        expanded the band's worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a
                        delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum
                        in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included
                        the singles "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises".

The
                        album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work
                        with the band on all their future recordings.
                        Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences
                        set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the
                        groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental
                        work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album's artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator
                        Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political
                        stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set
                        out to make a concept album.


Upon its release, OK Computer received almost
                        unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its
                        time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave
                        the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote "Here are 12 tracks
                        crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the
                        successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and
                        surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever
                        considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one
                        that deserves your attention more than any other released this
                        year." Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album's release to the era's
                        feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said "It's as pained and
                        as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one
                        way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves." Q awarded the album five out of five
                        stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that "the majority of OK Computer's 12 songs
                        ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and
                        ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It's a huge, mysterious album for the head
                        and soul." Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that "Others may end up selling more, but in 20
                        years time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the
                        key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and
                        song-structures from an earlier era." In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan
                        of The Guardian wrote that the album "is surprising and
                        sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen."

The album was
                        also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of
                        five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is
                        "a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had
                        begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that
                        [Radiohead] are one rock band still willing to look the devil square
                        in the eyes", but warned "OK Computer is not an easy listen." An Entertainment
                        Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that "When the arrangements
                        and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows
                        ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead's growing pains, though, their aim — to take
                        British pop to a heavenly new level — is true." In an article for The New Yorker, writer
                        Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and
                        contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the more musically conservative "dadrock"
                        of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that "Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and
                        style are extreme This band has pulled off one of the
                        great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock." Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly
                        enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that "Radiohead's
                        third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not
                        only their best yet, but one of the year's greatest releases. The record is brimming with
                        genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive
                        and fire-breathing."

Despite OK Computer's
                        widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice
                        granted OK Computer a B− but ranked it as the "Dud of the Month" in his consumer
                        guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked "soul",
                        calling it "arid" and "ridiculous" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink
                        Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, "For all its
                        ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The
                        Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to
                        be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency".
                        While a review in Time was largely positive,
                        particularly praising the songs "Airbag", "Paranoid Android", and "Let
                        Down", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley
                        stated, "While the first half-dozen tracks reward
                        repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no
                        structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers."

At the end of 1997, OK
                        Computer appeared in many critics' lists and listener
                        polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo,
                        Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied
                        for first place with Daft Punk's Homework in The Face.
                        The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q
                        and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was
                        a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award
                        recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of
                        the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately
                        winning the latter award.

OK Computer first
                        appeared in a "best of all time" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a
                        chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent
                        releases, which suggested that OK Computer's
                        popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional
                        lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader's poll of the
                        greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number
                        one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including
                        NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer
                        prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time.
                        In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500
                        greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant
                        Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling
                        Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield
                        saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M.,
                        everybody; and fans around the world loved them for
                        trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering."


OK Computer
                        was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as
                        encompassing public opinion through its
                        "despairing-yet-hopeful tone" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been
                        affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just
                        coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming
                        and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under
                        the "New Labour" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many
                        people felt the tone of the album was
                        millennial.

Some critics have credited OK Computer with "killing" 1990s
                        Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become
                        slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly
                        complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop
                        texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have
                        credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of
                        progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the
                        genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that "sound like us" as one reason
                        to break with the style of OK Computer for their next
                        album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of "bands
                        like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like [Radiohead] did in
                        1997", Yorke replied "Good luck with 'Kid
                        A'!".

Several rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay
                        and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer—TV
                        on the Radio's debut album, for instance, was titled OK
                        Calculator. Additionally, the album's popularity paved the way for British alternative rock
                        bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O'Riley
                        and Brad Mehldau have performed material from
                        OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said "When I heard 'OK Computer,'
                        after five minutes I said, 'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying
                        to do.' And what they were trying was not so drastically
                        different from what I was trying to do." Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album
                        in a Reggae style.

OK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics.
                        It is often cited as Radiohead's best work and as a
                        landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year,
                        and won for Best Alternative Music Album. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer"&gt;Read

					<summary>The Bends, released on 13 March 1995 in the United Kingdom and on 4 April 1995 in the
                        United States, is the second studio album released by the English rock band Radiohead. The album
                        was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album
                        contains singles "High and Dry", "Fake Plastic Trees", "Just",
                        "My Iron Lung", and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)".

The Bends was
                        ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of
                        All Time, and number 2 on Q's 100 Greatest Albums Ever. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends"&gt;Read

					<content>The Bends, released on 13 March 1995 in the United Kingdom and on 4 April 1995 in the
                        United States, is the second studio album released by the English rock band Radiohead. The album
                        was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album
                        contains singles "High and Dry", "Fake Plastic Trees", "Just",
                        "My Iron Lung", and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)".

The Bends was
                        ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of
                        All Time, and number 2 on Q's 100 Greatest Albums Ever.

The album was subject to
                        much greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), and it reached number four in
                        the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the
                        commercial success of their single "Creep" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked
                        on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead
                        albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales
                        certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.

According
                        to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke's songwriting from
                        personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global
                        themes that would come to dominate the band's later work. Most of the album was seen to
                        continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs "Fake
                        Plastic Trees" and, in particular, "Street
                        Spirit (Fade Out)" and its b-side "Talk Show Host", are often seen as a precursor
                        to their next album OK Computer (1997). "Fake Plastic Trees" was partly inspired by
                        the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while
                        "Sulk" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke,
                        "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.

The
                        lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those
                        of "My Iron Lung", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke's
                        alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke
                        would be the next "rock 'n roll martyr" or
                        suicide.

The Bends was the first of the band's full-length records with artwork by
                        Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name "The White Chocolate
                        Farm" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke
                        had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album
                        cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical
                        dummy with Yorke's own face. It is also the last Radiohead
                        album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.

The Bends met
                        with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in
                        1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a
                        standard-bearer of "indie" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height
                        of the '90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar
                        music; however, in the band's home country,
                        Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called "Britpop"
                        acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.

In
                        the United States, the album eventually
                        reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single "High and Dry"
                        reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a
                        bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for
                        R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.

The
                        Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer
                        listed it as one of "the 50 albums that
                        changed music", saying, "Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden
                        falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's Liam
                        Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice
                        to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually
                        coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor
                        James Blunt." Radiohead members said they later distanced
                        themselves from their mid '90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those
                        that adopted the sound.

The Bends took second place behind Radiohead's OK Computer
                        in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the
                        best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's list of
                        the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating.
                        In 2000, Virgin's Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked
                        The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends"&gt;Read

					<content>The King of Limbs is the eighth studio album by English alternative rock band Radiohead,
                        produced by Nigel Godrich. It was released on 18 February 2011 as a download in MP3 and WAV
                        formats. It was followed by a physical CD release on 28
                        March 2011. A special "newspaper" edition was released on 9 May. The "newspaper"
                        edition will contain two 10-inch vinyl records in a special record sleeve, many large sheets of
                        artwork, 625 tiny pieces of artwork, a compact disc,
                        and a colour piece of oxo-degradable plastic package. The album will be released by Ticker Tape
                        in the United States, XL in the United Kingdom and Hostess Entertainment in Japan.

The
                        album was announced on Radiohead's website on 14
                        February 2011, four days before release. The name of the album refers to an oak tree in
                        Wiltshire's Savernake Forest, thought to be 1,000 years old. The tree is a pollarded oak,
                        referring to an ancient technique for harvesting timber for fencing
                        and firewood. Though it does not feature on maps, the tree is said to be 3 miles (4.8 km) from
                        Tottenham Court House, where Radiohead recorded part of their previous album In Rainbows. On 18
                        February, Radiohead's official blog published the
                        first song from the album, "Lotus Flower", with an accompanying music video, followed
                        by a post announcing the album was released. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+King+of+Limbs"&gt;Read

				<content>Radiohead are an English alternative rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK which formed in 1985. The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed
        O'Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion).

The early years (1992 – 1995)
Radiohead released their first single, "Creep" in 1992. The song was initially
        unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band's
        textured guitar parts and Yorke's falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. 

International success (1996 - 2000)
Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame.
        Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s.

A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 – 2003)
Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the
        band's musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock,
        electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band's final album for their major record label, EMI. 

Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013)
In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows,
        originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success.

In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described
        as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures.

In February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013,
        following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace.

Ninth Studio Album - "A Moon Shaped Pool" (2016)
After much speculation, on May 8, 2016, Radiohead released their long awaited
        ninth album,"A Moon Shaped Pool" on various streaming services. The band announced the release of their latest 11-track album on Twitter. The first track from the album was "Burn the Witch".

Glastonbury 2017
On
        October 20, 2016, Radiohead was announced as the headline act for the opening night at Glastonbury Music Festival in June 2017. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is

                        Lanois.

Working at their Las Vegas studio, Battle Born, the band worked with producers,
                        Steve Lillywhite, Damian Taylor, Brendan O'Brien, Stuart Price and Daniel Lanois.
                        Initially, the band had wanted to work with just one, however,
                        scheduling provided difficult for each.

The album was partially mixed by Alan Moulder
                        who also worked on the band's first two albums.

On June 7, 2012, The Killers
                        released a trailer for their new album Battle Born. The track
                        listing was announced on August 16. Battle Born was released on September 17, 2012 in the United
                        Kingdom and on September 18 in the United States. On the same date, the album was released as a
                        vinyl disc.


The first single from the album
                        is "Runaways", which received its first radio play on July 10, 2012.The single was
                        leaked on Tumblr only hours before its official radio preview. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Battle+Born"&gt;Read

                        "Smile Like You Mean It". 

Towards the end of 2005, The Killers also released
                        the album on 7" vinyl in a boxset of 11 discs. On side A of each of the discs is the album
                        track, and on the B-side are non-album tracks. It is also
                        one of the last five albums, in order of chronology, to be placed in the "1001 Albums You
                        Must Hear Before You Die". Hot Fuss sold more than 2,500,000 copies in the first year of
                        its release. After being nominated for five Grammys, it has
                        since sold more than 5,000,000 copies worldwide.

Murder Trilogy:

2 of the
                        songs on the album ("Jenny Was a Friend of Mine" and "Midnight Show") are a
                        continuing story along with "Leave the Bourbon On The
                        Shelf" from Sawdust, which is known as the Murder Trilogy. The band have also said they may
                        expand this in the future. The order of the songs is the reverse of how they appeared on the
                        albums, with "Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf"
                        being first, followed by "Midnight Show" and finally "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine".
                        In their official biography the Killers explain a few of the theories behind the Murder Trilogy.
                        For example Brandon Flowers says "There was
                        water involved, although he didn’t drown her."

Hot Fuss was released on June 7,
                        2004 in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004 in the United States. The album reached top of
                        the album charts in both the United Kingdom and Australia and
                        was certified 3x Platinum in Canada (300,000 units) by the CRIA in October 2005. It stayed in
                        the Top 50 of the Billboard 200 chart for over fifty weeks. Singles from the album include, in
                        order released, "Somebody Told Me", "Mr.
                        Brightside", "All These Things That I've Done" and "Smile Like You Mean
                        It". Towards the end of 2005, The Killers also released the album on 7" vinyl in a box
                        set of 11 discs. On side A of each disc is the album
                        track and on the B-side are non-album tracks. It is also one of the five most recent albums
                        listed as one of the 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Hot Fuss sold more than 2,500,000
                        copies in the first year of its release.

Initial
                        critical response to Hot Fuss was generally positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized
                        rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of
                        66, based on 20 reviews. Rolling Stone gave the album
                        three-and-a-half stars out of five. Reviewer Jenny Eliscu compared the band's music to
                        contemporaries The Rapture and Franz Ferdinand, stating that in comparison to those groups The
                        Killers "have actual pop songs -- in spades". Eliscu
                        concluded, "This album is all Killers, no filler." In a mixed review, Entertainment
                        Weekly wildly praised the song "Somebody Told Me" while asking "As for the rest,
                        isn't it a little too early for a Strokes tribute
                        band?", and ultimately gave the album a "C". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Hot+Fuss"&gt;Read

					<summary>Sam's Town is the second studio album by Las Vegas rock band The Killers, released on
                        October 2, 2006 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States. The album is
                        said to be influenced by the works of U2, Bruce
                        Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, among others. Sam's Town received mixed
                        reviews, with some praising The Killers' new direction and others criticising it.

The
                        album takes its name from Sam's Town Hotel and
                        Gambling Hall, a hotel-casino in Las Vegas, the hometown of the band. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Sam%27s+Town"&gt;Read

					<content>Sam's Town is the second studio album by Las Vegas rock band The Killers, released on
                        October 2, 2006 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States. The album is
                        said to be influenced by the works of U2, Bruce
                        Springsteen and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, among others. Sam's Town received mixed
                        reviews, with some praising The Killers' new direction and others criticising it.

The
                        album takes its name from Sam's Town Hotel and
                        Gambling Hall, a hotel-casino in Las Vegas, the hometown of the band. The bikini-clad woman on
                        the cover of Sam's Town is model and singer Felice LaZae. The album's co-producer
                        Flood is dressed as a Native American in the CD booklet. The
                        artwork inside the album booklet is taken from a downtown-Las Vegas mural painted by Suzanne
                        Hackett-Morgan, a local painter.

In the US, the album opened at #2, selling 315,000 in
                        its first week. The album went straight to #1 in the UK
                        selling over 260,000 in a week. As of March 2007, the album has sold about 2,750,000 copies
                        worldwide. The album has been certified 2x Platinum in Canada. As of July 11, 2007, it has sold
                        1,205,621 copies in the US. A late surge in sales in the
                        United Kingdom and a continued flow of international sales means that Sam's Town is fast
                        approaching Hot Fuss with almost 4 million sales worldwide to date. The album has sold over
                        1,200,000 copies in the UK.

In the 2007 Chris Rock
                        movie I Think I Love My Wife, Richard Cooper supposedly picks up Sam's Town while in a
                        music store. Also, when Cooper begins to speak with Nelson, a poster of an NME magazine cover
                        can be seen in the background with all four members of the band
                        on it. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Killers/Sam%27s+Town"&gt;Read more on

5) a British punk rock band from the 1970s
6) An American doo wop group from the 1950s

1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in
        2001 and consist of Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band's four studio albums to date have sold in excess of
        18 million copies worldwide combined. The band got its name from the fictional band "The Killers" in the video for New Order's "Crystal". The band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their 4th studio album in
        early 2011. Songfacts reports that "Runaways", the first single from "Battle Born", was released on July 10, 2012. 
Initially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band's line-up stable and their
        repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts — and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with
        him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label.
They released their debut album "Hot Fuss" on June
        2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was "Somebody Told Me". The band also had chart success with their singles "Mr. Brightside," which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and "All
        These Things That I've Done".
The band started recording its second album, "Sam's Town" on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. Lead singer, Brandon Flowers said that
        Sam's Town is "one of the best albums of the past 20 years". Though the album has received a mixed response from critics and fans, it has still remained popular and sold over 4 million copies worldwide.
The first single, "When
        You Were Young" debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album's debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its
        official release went to #2 in the UK. The video clip of the second single, "Bones", was directed by Tim Burton. The third single was "Read My Mind". The video was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. The last one was "For Reasons
        Unknown" released in June, 2007.
The album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. Brandon Flowers announced on August 22, 2007, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at the T
        Vital Festival, that it would be the last time that the album "Sam's Town" would be played in Europe. The Killers played their last Sam's Town concert in Melbourne, Australia on November, 2007.
Much of The Killers' music
        is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band's songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where
        everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80's such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits,
        David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen's music and lyrics.
The compilation album called "Sawdust", containing
        B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. The album's first single "Tranquilize," a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division's
        "Shadowplay" on the U.S. iTunes Store. The album also contains the songs "Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town" (a The First Edition cover), "Romeo and Juliet" (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of "Move
        Away" (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is "Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf" the first but previously unreleased part of the so called "Murder Trilogy," in which it is followed
        by "Midnight Show" then "Jenny Was a Friend of Mine"
The Cowboys' Christmas Ball Songfacts reports that The Killers are recognized for their work with Bono's Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS
        in Africa. In 2006 they released their first Christmas themed song and music video, "A Great Big Sled" in aid of the charity,followed by "Don't Shoot Me Santa" on December 1, 2007. Their festive tunes have subsequently became
        an annual event and "The Cowboy's Christmas Ball" was released as their sixth successive release intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on December 1, 2011.
"Day and Age" was the title of The Killers third
        studio album. The title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers. The band headed to the studio in June and the album is being produced by Stuart Price. In the October 2008 edition of
        German magazine Musikexpress, in an article dated August 15, 2008, Keuning says the new record was 99% finished. The Killers selected Paul Normansell to do the artwork for the new album, which should include some of Normansell's artwork and
        portraits of the band themselves. 
Flowers also stated in an interview with Q that he was excited to play a new song called "Tidal Wave", influenced by David Bowie's "Drive-In Saturday" and "I Drove All Night"
        by Roy Orbison. The setlist of The Killers' July 29 and August 1, 2008 show at New York City's Highline Ballroom and Atlantic City's Borgata Hotel and Spa contained two new songs: Spaceman and Neon Tiger. These songs were also played
        at The Killers' show on July 31st at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Spaceman and Neon Tiger are also included on "Day and Age". During their brief summer tour in 2008, The Killers confirmed several other
        potential song titles for "Day and Age" including "Goodnight, Travel Well", "Vibration", "Joy Ride", "I Can't Stay", "Losing Touch", "Fairytale Dustland" and
        "Human", although "Vibration" wasn't included.
The Killers' third studio album "Day and Age" (which was reviewed at http://www.silentsoundwaves.com/album-reviews/the-killers-day-age-review/) was released on
        25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). The album's first single "Human" was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ's suggesting it was the best
        single by The Killers yet.
Killers frontman Brandon Flowers recently (December 2008) has said that he thinks his band will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think. He told The Daily Telegraph that "U2 are unbelievable,
        but they're getting old. It feels like it's time". 
The Killers' fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released 18 September 2012. It took 15 months to record. The band began recording it after they took a touring break for a
        little over a year. The album has five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, "The Rising Tide." The debut single was "Runaways," followed by "Miss Atomic Bomb," "Here with Me," and
        "The Way it Was."

					<summary>Parachutes is the Grammy award-winning debut album by English rock band Coldplay, released
                        on July 10, 2000 in the UK and on November 7 in the U.S.. Parachutes quickly shot to number one
                        in the United Kingdom, staying in the top ten for
                        thirty-three weeks.

The album produced four hit singles: "Shiver", "Yellow",
                        "Trouble", and "Don't Panic". In the United States, the album peaked at
                        only fifty-one on the Billboard 200 yet, it
                        still managed to sell over two million copies within a year. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes"&gt;Read

                        still managed to sell over two million copies within a year.

Parachutes won the Grammy
                        Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2002. It was placed at #14 in Channel 4's 100
                        greatest albums of all time and in 2006 at #33 in NME's
                        100 greatest British albums. Despite the album's critical and commercial success, lead
                        singer Chris Martin said that Coldplay looks beyond Parachutes. "We know that's
                        terrible music," he said, "and we always try to think
                        about what we can do next." &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/Parachutes"&gt;Read

				<content>Coldplay is a British alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom in 1997. The band comprises vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland – who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of
        residence) at University College London - bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion.

Not only have Coldplay had 7 highly successful studio album releases (all of which reached #1 on the UK album chart) - with their latest 7th studio
        album released on December 4, 2015 (A Head Full of Dreams) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as Yellow, Speed of Sound, the Grammy-winning Clocks and the US and UK #1 single Viva La
        Vida.


Influences
Coldplay's early material was often compared to that of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of the band's debut album, Parachutes (2000), Coldplay
        has also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&amp;Y (2005).

Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band
        a-ha for inspiring him to form his own band.

Coldplay never intended to become England's favorite rock &amp; roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit,
        plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody
        Valentine.

They never imagined taking reign of the UK's ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Chris Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the
        piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Jonny Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11.
        Scotland native Guy Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle,
        but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official.

When they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis. They played their first gig at a festival for
        unsigned bands in Manchester, and the Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers &amp; Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings.) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed
        Coldplay a UK deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition Blue Room EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming
        personas. Two more EPs, Shiver and Yellow, arrived in Spring 2000.

Albums
The band has released 5 albums with the latest sixth album scheduled for release in May 2014: Parachutes (2000), A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&amp;Y
        (2005), Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyoto (2011) and in May 2014, Ghost Stories (2014).

Parachutes (2000)
Their full-length debut album, Parachutes, earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK.
        It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later Yellow, was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for
        three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumors of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a
        European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single Trouble.

A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002)
By the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album.
        Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay's last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued a year later.
        Capturing the band's show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, it highlighted Coldplay's monumental success worldwide with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying
        actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple's first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April.

X&amp;Y (2005)
Fatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording
        material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with long-time producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (Morrissey, The Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&amp;Y. Speed Of Sound
        marked Coldplay's first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain.

Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends
        (2008)
Coldplay's fourth album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single Violet Hill having been previously released as a free download through their official website
        for a week from April 29, 2008. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. 
The album received lots of positive feedback for its
        originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less 'synth-dependent' riffs. It offered a great insight into how significantly the band's music had adapted and developed to themselves and the public.

Charity duet (single) for
        World AIDS Day (2008)
Barely a week before the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released, a duet with Kylie Minogue, which was intended to be used on the album, was scrapped with the comment that 'it’s just too sexy […]
        also we haven’t quite finished it'. The track, Lhuna was subsequently released as a charity single to promote World AIDS Day 2008 on December 1, 2008.

Mylo Xyloto (2011)
Coldplay's fifth album, Mylo Xyloto, was released on
        October 24, 2011, with the first two tracks from the album - Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradise - were released on June 3, 2011 and September 12, 2012 respectively. The album was no.1 in over 34 countries, and has sold over 8m copies
        worldwide.

Ghost Stories (2014)
The band's sixth album, Ghost Stories, was officially released on May 19, 2014. Prior to the release, Coldplay made the full album available to stream via iTunes, with an animation of the album
        artwork designed by Mila Fürstová, one week ahead of the official release date. The first track from the album, Midnight was released on February 25, 2014. The album was recorded at The Bakery and The Beehive studios in London, England. Ghost Stories
        entered the Billboard 200 as Number 1 and marked Coldplay's fourth straight number 1 studio album, selling 383,000 copies in the US in the week ending May 25, 2014 - of which 64% came from digital downloads according to Billboard.

A
        Head Full of Dreams (2015)
The band's 7th studio album, A Head Full of Dreams, was released December 4, 2015 on the Parlophone label. The 11-track album (with an additional hidden track called “X Marks The Spot”) was recorded in LA and
        London, and was produced by Stargate and Rik Simpson. A world tour is promised to accompany the album in 2016.

Super Bowl - February 2016
Coldplay headlined at the much coverted Super Bowl 50 half-time show on February 7, 2016. The band
        performed a remixed version of their hit single "Yellow", before playing "Vida La Vida", "Paradise" and their 2015 single "Adventure Of A Lifetime". Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson then took to the stage to perform
        their hit "Uptown Funk", before Beyoncé emerged on stage with her latest single "Formation".

2016 - First US tour since 2012
Coldplay announced its Head Full of Dreams tour on January 28, 2016 - the first in the USA
        since 2012. The first concert will be held at MetLife Stadium (New York) on July 16, 2016.

Commercial endorsements
Coldplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large
        worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who
        wanted to use the songs Yellow, Trouble, and Don't Panic respectively. According to Martin, "We wouldn't be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs' meanings like that." On the other hand, Yellow has been used to
        back TV trailers for "The Simpsons" and Viva La Vida featured on an iTunes TV advert.

Political and social activism
Since 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible
        advocates of Oxfam's Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.

				<content>Edward Christopher "Ed" Sheeran (born 17 February 1991) is a singer songwriter currently signed under Atlantic (WMG). Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire before moving to Framlingham, Suffolk. In his time in Suffolk, he was
        known to have flourished as a hidden talent when it came to music. He learned guitar at a very young age, and began writing songs during his time at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham. By the time Sheeran had left school, he was already certain
        that music was going to play a major part in his life, and therefore studied at Access To Music in Norwich before moving to London which improved his chances of getting gigs.

Sheeran began recording in 2005, which lead to the release of his
        first EP, The Orange Room EP. Sheeran also released two albums, a self titled one in 2006 and Want Some? in 2007 gaining little attention. After Sheeran moved to London and had done extensive gigging, performing songs from his EP and albums, as well
        as ones which he had recently written, he decided to release another EP, You Need Me in late 2009. However, it wasn't until February 2010 that Sheeran began to get noticed after he posted a video through SB.tv displaying his diverse style. This
        video led to mainstream rapper Example asking Sheeran to tour with him. Throughout 2010, Sheeran began to be seen by more and more people over the internet through Youtube and his fan-base grew incredibly, with him also getting credit from The
        Independent newspaper, England football captain Rio Ferdinand and even Elton John. Sheeran released three EP's in 2010, Loose Change, which features one of his most known songs, "The A Team", Songs I Wrote With Amy, and Ed Sheeran:
        Live at the Bedford, a live EP recorded in October. During the year, Sheeran also went to the US, where he was discovered by international superstar Jamie Foxx, who asked Sheeran to perform on his radio show, which gained him some fans in the US. By
        the end of the year, Sheeran was seen to be one of the best unsigned artists in the country. 
On 9 January 2011, Sheeran released his final independent EP, No.5 Collaborations Project featuring appearances by grime artists including Wiley, JME,
        Devlin and Ghetts. With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for reaching number 2 in the iTunes chart, without any promotion or label. He was listed as a 'special guest' on Devlin's 2011 'Bud, Sweat and Beers' mini
        tour alongside Griminal and Tinchy Stryder. Songfacts reports that after signing for Atlantic Records in January 2011 "The A Team" was released as the first single from his debut album on June 12, 2011.

Sheeran's debut album +
        containing the singles The A Team and Lego House is certified 6x Platinum in the UK. The album has also won Sheeran two Brit Awards for British Breakthrough Act and Best British Male Solo Artist. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards Sheeran gained a
        nomination for Best New Artist. 

He received further fame for contributing the track entitled "I See Fire" to Howard Shore's soundtrack to the movie "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" in 2013.

x the
        second studio album by Sheeran was released in 2015. The album went straight to number one in both the UK and the US. x has had five singles thus far Sing, Don't, Thinking Out Loud, Bloodstream and Photograph.

Sheeran recently was
        awarded with an Honorary Doctorate by the University Campus Suffolk (UCS). The ceremony is later this year.

					<content>Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (stylized as good kid, m.A.A.d city) is the second studio album by
                        American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar. The album was released on October 22, 2012, by
                        Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and
                        distributed by Interscope Records. The album serves as Lamar's major label debut, after his
                        signing to Aftermath and Interscope in early 2012. It was preceded by the release of Kendrick's
                        first studio album Section.80 (2011), released
                        exclusively through iTunes independently.

The album was recorded mostly at several
                        studios in California with producers such as, Dr. Dre, Just Blaze, Pharrell Williams, Hit-Boy,
                        Scoop DeVille, Jack Splash and T-Minus, among others. Billed as
                        a "short film by Kendrick Lamar" on the album cover, the concept album follows the
                        story of a Lamar's teenage experiences in the drug infested streets and gang lifestyle of
                        his native Compton, California. 

Upon its release,
                        Good Kid, M.A.A.D City received rave reviews from music critics, who praised its thematic scope
                        and Lamar's lyrics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart, selling
                        242,000 copies in its first week – earning the highest
                        first-week hip hop album sales of 2012 from a male artist, along with the best-selling debut
                        from a male artist of the year. The album generated 2.8 million streams through Spotify,
                        becoming the second highest first week stream total of the year. It
                        became Lamar's first album to enter the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number 16, and entering
                        the UK R&amp;B Albums Chart at number two. It was certified platinum by the Recording Industry
                        Association of America (RIAA) and, by July 2013, had sold
                        980,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/good+kid,+m.A.A.d+city"&gt;Read

					<content>Section.80 is the debut studio album by American hip hop recording artist Kendrick Lamar,
                        released exclusively through the iTunes Store on July 2, 2011, under Top Dawg Entertainment. The
                        album features guest appearances from GLC, Colin

                        from production group Digi+Phonics, along with THC, Tommy Black, Wyldfyer,
                        Terrace Martin and J. Cole. The concept album features lyrical themes delivered by Lamar such as
                        racism and medication tolerance, and was well received by contemporary music critics.

The
                        album's lead single "HiiiPoWeR", was
                        released April 2011. Section.80 sold 5,400 copies in the US solely based upon digital downloads
                        within less than a week, debuting and peaking at number 113 on the US Billboard 200 chart with
                        minimal mainstream media promotion and coverage - however
                        some sources suggest the album entered at number 104. Within a two-week period the album sales
                        had totalled to 9,522. As of October 2012 the album has sold 78,000 copies. &lt;a

                        Lamar. The album was released on March 16, 2015, by Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath
                        Entertainment, and distributed by Interscope Records. Upon its

                        fearful and unapologetic." In an interview with Rolling
                        Stone magazine, Kendrick indicated that the title was a play on Harper Lee's novel, To Kill
                        a Mockingbird. He was quoted as saying, "Just putting the word 'pimp' next to
                        'butterfly'… It's a trip. That's
                        something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses — I truly
                        believe that."

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to
                        reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score
                        of 95, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 13 reviews. Anthony Fantano of The
                        Needle Drop gave it a perfect score, making it the third 10/10 he's given to a contemporary
                        album. &lt;a

				<content>Kendrick Lamar (born Kendrick Lamar Duckworth June 17, 1987) is a rapper from Compton, California. He is also a member of the hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy collective along with members Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q. His music is
        largely influenced by the works of 2Pac, Jay-Z, Nas and DMX.

He began to gain major recognition in 2010, after his first retail release, Overly Dedicated. The following year, Lamar independently released his first studio album, Section.80,
        which included his debut single, "HiiiPoWeR". By that time, he had amassed a large Internet following and collaborated with several artists in the hip hop industry, including The Game, Snoop Dogg, Busta Rhymes and Lil Wayne.

Lamar
        secured a major-label record deal with Aftermath and Interscope Records, in 2012. His major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was released in October 2012 to critical success. The record contained the top 40 singles "Swimming Pools
        (Drank)", "Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe", and "Poetic Justice". It debuted at number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart and was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Lamar won
        his first Grammy Award for "i", lead single from his critical acclaimed third album To Pimp a Butterfly (2015). The album drew on free jazz, funk, soul, and spoken word, debuted atop the charts in the U.S. and the UK, and won the Grammy
        Award for Best Rap Album at the 58th ceremony. In 2016, Lamar released untitled unmastered., a collection of unreleased demos that originated during the recording sessions for Butterfly.

Lamar has received a number of accolades over the
        course of his career, including seven Grammy Awards. In early 2013, MTV named Lamar the number one "Hottest MC in the Game", on their annual list. Time named Lamar one of the 100 most influential people in the world in
        2016.

Lamar's fourth album, DAMN. was released April 17, 2017 to widespread critical acclaim. It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, earning Lamar his third consecutive number one album in the United States. The album was
        supported by the lead single, "Humble".

					<content>Foo Fighters is the debut album by the Foo Fighters, recorded entirely by frontman Dave
                        Grohl. It was released in 1995 through Roswell and Capitol Records. It was nominated for Best
                        Alternative Music Album at the 1996 Grammy ceremony, but it
                        lost to Dave Grohl's former band Nirvana's album MTV Unplugged In New York. Dave Grohl
                        has often called the Foo Fighters' debut piece to be more of a demo than an album.

Nearly
                        all of the album's instrumental parts are
                        performed by Dave Grohl. (The lone exception is a guitar part on "X-Static" provided
                        by Afghan Whigs member Greg Dulli, with whom Grohl had performed as part of an all-star band on
                        the 1994 Backbeat soundtrack.)

The Foo Fighters
                        band, originally consisting of bassist Nate Mendel, guitarist Pat Smear, and drummer William
                        Goldsmith, was formed by Grohl after the completion of the album in order to promote it on tour.
                        Despite not appearing on the album itself, the band is
                        featured in the liner notes and was paid royalties for the album.

Grohl had been
                        recording his own music for years prior, releasing a cassette called Pocketwatch (under the
                        moniker "Late!") during his time in Nirvana. The album was
                        recorded in October 1994 in Robert Lang's Studio in Seattle with friend/producer Barrett
                        Jones. This was the same studio where Nirvana recorded its last session just nine months prior.

The
                        gun featured on the cover is the "XZ-38
                        Disintegrator Pistol," which was originally released in 1935 as a tie-in toy for the Buck
                        Rogers comic strip and radio show. The guns were originally manufactured by Daisy, best known
                        for their line of youth BB guns, and today remain
                        sought-after collector's items.

The cover was shot by Grohl's then-wife,
                        photographer Jennifer Youngblood, and, like the name of his band, reflects his interest in
                        science fiction.

Foo Fighters reached #3 in the UK and #23
                        in the US, being certified Platinum on January 26th 1996.

On Foo Fighters'
                        2005-2006 live set with Weezer, the band brought "Big Me" back into their live setlist
                        after Weezer covered the song at several shows, as Weezer have
                        been longtime fans of the Foo Fighters. In 1995 Dave Grohl sent Weezer leader Rivers Cuomo a
                        copy of the Foo Fighters debut with a note saying he really liked The Blue Album.

The
                        album won the band their first and only MTV VMA for "Big
                        Me."

					<summary>Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four
                        months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the
                        Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the
                        Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions,
                        decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they
                        re-recorded nearly all of the album (save "Tired of You") in a

                        2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included "All My Life", "
                        Times Like These", "Low", and "Have It
                        All". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in
                        2005, "Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We
                        rushed into it, and we rushed out of it." &lt;a

					<summary>The Colour and the Shape is the Foo Fighters second album. It was released May 20, 1997
                        through Roswell/Capitol Records.

The album was the debut of the Foo Fighters as a band,
                        as frontman Dave Grohl had recorded all of the first
                        album by himself with the exception of one guitar part by Greg Dulli. The Colour and the Shape
                        was produced by Gil Norton, who was perhaps best known for his work with the Pixies. It was
                        loosely conceived by Grohl as a concept album which documented
                        the beginning and end of a romantic relationship. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape"&gt;Read

                        was produced by Gil Norton, who was perhaps best known for his work with the Pixies. It was
                        loosely conceived by Grohl as a concept album which documented
                        the beginning and end of a romantic relationship. Over the course of the making of the album,
                        Grohl's own marriage to photographer Jennifer Youngblood ultimately ended in divorce.

After
                        six weeks of work at Bear Creek Studios in
                        Woodinville, Washington, the band took two weeks off from recording. Grohl returned to Virginia
                        and wrote several new songs, recording one of them, Walking After You, by himself at WGNS
                        Studios in Washington, DC. The band (minus drummer William
                        Goldsmith) relocated to Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood, California, and re-recorded most of
                        the album with Grohl performing the drum tracks (some segments from the Bear Creek sessions with
                        Goldsmith on drums appear on the finished album,
                        including the entirety of Doll).

The album reached number three in the UK and number
                        ten in the United States. The Colour and the Shape is the Foo Fighters' biggest U.S.
                        seller, having sold over two million copies according to Nielsen
                        SoundScan.

Even though the Foo Fighters are an American band, the word 'Colour'
                        in the album title is always spelled with the British spelling. This was a nod to producer
                        Norton, who is British. To commemorate the album's
                        tenth anniversary, it was re-released on July 10, 2007, and included six previously released
                        B-sides, consisting of Dear Lover, The Colour and the Shape, and four covers, including Baker
                        Street.

The album was in total nominated for 5 VMAs in
                        1997 and 1998, for the videos Monkey Wrench and Everlong. It was also a Grammy nominee for Best
                        Rock Album in 1998.

Walking After You was re-recorded in 1998 by the full band (with
                        recent additions Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl) and
                        released as a single as part of the soundtrack to the X-Files movie.

This would be the
                        band's only collaboration with Norton until the recording of Echoes, Silence, Patience
                        &amp; Grace in 2007.

Down in the Park was recorded in
                        January 1996 at Bob Lang's Studio in Seattle, Washington. It was originally released on
                        Songs in the Key of X: Music From and Inspired by the X-Files in 1996. Early takes of My Hero
                        and Enough Space were also recorded during the session. &lt;a

					<content>There Is Nothing Left to Lose is the third album by the Foo Fighters, released in 1999,
                        following the band's biggest seller The Colour and the Shape. Their first release on the
                        BMG label, the album debuted and peaked at #10 both in the
                        US and UK, and broadened their fanbase further with such hits as Learn to Fly, Stacked Actors,
                        Breakout and Next Year. Many of the songs stray from the band's first two albums because
                        they have a mildly experimental feel. The album is also more
                        radio-friendly, with less abrasive vocals and less angry and aggressive songs than other Foo
                        Fighters albums.

It was the first album recorded with permanent drummer Taylor Hawkins,
                        and last album to not feature permanent guitarist Chris
                        Shiflett, who replaced former guitarist Franz Stahl. Stahl departed the band just prior to the
                        album's recording due to creative differences, wanting to play harder edged songs like the
                        previous albums featured. Since There Is Nothing Left to
                        Lose, the Foo Fighters have held up the same line-up of Dave Grohl, Shiflett, Hawkins, and Nate
                        Mendel.

Early pressings of the disc included a temporary tattoo, similar to the one
                        featured on the album cover. The album was also re-released
                        in 2001 as a two-CD edition which offers a second VCD disc of four videos and one bonus track,
                        Fraternity. This edition has a picture of the Australian swimmer Michael Klim on the front,
                        chosen because he has a Foo Fighters tattoo on his left
                        shoulder, and has also admitted to be a Foo Fighters fan several times.

Singer/guitarist
                        Dave Grohl has stated before that the album was recorded at his home and that the band would
                        have "a BBQ every day after
                        recording."

This album was the first Foo Fighters album to have a song reach the
                        top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with Learn to Fly. It started a pattern of every Foo
                        Fighters album having more weeks at the top of the chart than the
                        one before it (There Is Nothing Left to Lose - 1 week; One By One - 10 weeks; In Your Honor - 13
                        weeks; Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace - 25 weeks).

The album is widely available
                        as an "Enhanced CD". &lt;a

				<content>Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist/drummer Dave Grohl in 1995 in Seattle, USA. Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band Nirvana in 1994. Prior to the release of Foo
        Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft), and Pat Smear (guitar) (of The Germs) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group's
        second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose
        (1999).

Chris Shiflett joined as the band's second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor
        (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band's career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for
        Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band's seventh album Wasting Light was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries.

Formation and debut album
Dave Grohl joined the band Nirvana as the
        group's drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, "I was in awe of frontman Kurt Cobain's songs. And intimidated. I
        thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself." Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym "Late!" in
        1992.

Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in Tom Petty and the
        Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on "X-Static" by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played
        every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. "I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life," Grohl later said. "I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing
        music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there's nothing anyone can really do to discourage me." Grohl completed an album's worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for
        feedback.

Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title "Foo Fighters", taken from the World War II term "foo fighter", used to refer to unidentified flying objects.
        According to Rope Songfacts, he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry,
        creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. "For Krist and I, it would have felt
        really natural and really great", Grohl explained. "But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope." Having heard about the
        disbanding of Seattle-based emo band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group's bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album
        In Utero, to join as the group's second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records.

The group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl
        refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band's first single "This Is a Call" was released in June 1995, and its
        debut album Foo Fighters was released the next month. "I'll Stick Around", "For All The Cows" and "Big Me" were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first
        appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August.

The Colour and the Shape
After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album.
        While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there,
        Grohl realized that he wasn't happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band "basically re-recorded almost everything". During the L.A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him
        that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band.

In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette's touring drummer Taylor Hawkins to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl
        was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, The Colour and the Shape, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles "Monkey Wrench",
        "My Hero", and "Everlong".

Pat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously
        publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl's former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie
        soundtracks, a re-recording of "Walking After You" for The X-Files and "A320" for Godzilla.

There Is Nothing Left to Lose
In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl's home state of Virginia to write music for its
        third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, "In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't". Grohl was distraught
        about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's
        Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including "Learn to Fly", the band's first single to reach the US Hot 100.

Before the release of the album, Capitol president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label.
        Given Grohl's history with Gersh, Foo Fighters' contract had included a "key man clause" that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh's departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed to RCA, who later acquired the
        rights to the band's Capitol albums.
Chris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member

After recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled
        on Chris Shiflett, who previously performed with No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group's fourth
        album.

That same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band Queen, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters' second cover of Pink Floyd's
        "Have a Cigar", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on "Tie Your Mother
        Down", with Grohl filling in on vocals for Freddie Mercury. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to "Tired of You" and an outtake called "Knucklehead". The bands have performed together on several occasions since,
        including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters' headlining concert in Hyde Park.

One by One
Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album,
        Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their
        album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save "Tired of You") in a ten-day stretch at Grohl's studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album
        included "All My Life", "Times Like These", "Low", and "Have It All". The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, "Four of the songs were good, and the other
        seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it."

For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new
        Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush's presidential campaign was using "Times Like These" at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry's campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies
        and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates.

In Your Honor and acoustic tour
Having spent a year and a half touring
        behind One By One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted
        to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs–one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album's
        singles included "Best of You", "DOA", "Resolve", "No Way Back", and "Miracle".

On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London's
        Hyde Park. The band was supported by Juliette and the Licks, Angels &amp; Airwaves, Queens of the Stone Age, and Motörhead. Motörhead's Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing "Shake Your Blood" from Dave Grohl's Probot album.
        Also, as a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of "We Will Rock You" as a lead into "Tie Your Mother Down".

In further support of In Your Honor, the band
        decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, Petra Haden on violin and backup vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The
        Wallflowers on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on In Your Honor's acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as "Ain't It The Life", "Floaty", and "See
        You". The band also performed "Marigold", a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a Nirvana B-side.

In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, Skin and Bones, featuring fifteen performances captured
        over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD.

Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace
For the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band decided to call in The Colour and
        the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace was released in September 2007. The album's first single, "The Pretender", was issued to radio in early August. The second single, "Long Road to Ruin", was
        released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads).

In mid-to-late 2007 "The Pretender" topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave
        the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides Red Hot Chili Peppers to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When "Long Road to Ruin" reached the top it gave
        them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, "Let It Die", reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. "Let It
        Die" is also the album's third Number One hit on the chart.

Not long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set
        of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp;
        Grace. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada.

Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp;
        Grace was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for "The Pretender"). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while "The Pretender" was also
        nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song.

On 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also
        informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. "We've never really taken a long break, I think it's time," Grohl commented. "After doing Wembley, we shouldn't come back there for 10 years because we've
        played to everybody. We're over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it's time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us."

 Wasting Light 

After taking a break from music, Foo Fighters
        returned in 2011 with the album Wasting Light. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl's garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating "There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a
        garage." Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. 

Foo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song "Bridge Burning", and on
        February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of "Miss the Misery". On February 12th, the music video for "White Limo" was released. And on February
        23rd "Rope" was released for online streaming. 

On March 1st "Rope" was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts.

On April
        9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song "Rope" for their first performance, and debuted the song "Walk" for their second. 

Wasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart
        in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. 

Musical style
When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl
        acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, "Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that's stripped down." Foo Fighters also utilize the
        Pixies' technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana "liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I
        suppose". Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum
        parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, "I could hear the song in my head before it was finished." Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song
        arrangements.

The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, "We all love music, whether it's the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and
        immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we're all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural."

Campaigning and activism
In 2000, the band generated controversy through their public
        support of Alive &amp; Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist Nate Mendel learned of Alive &amp; Well
        through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization's founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his
        advocacy.

In January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore's husband Robin
        Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band's position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive &amp; Well's advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel
        spoke of using Foo Fighters' popularity to help spread the group's message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of
        supported causes.

					<content>The cliché about David Bowie says he's a musical chameleon, adapting himself according
                        to fashion and trends. While such a criticism is too glib, there's no denying that Bowie
                        demonstrated remarkable skill for perceiving musical
                        trends at his peak in the '70s. After spending several years in the late '60s as a mod
                        and as an all-around music-hall entertainer, Bowie reinvented himself as a hippie
                        singer/songwriter. Prior to his breakthrough in 1972, he recorded a
                        proto-metal record and a pop/rock album, eventually redefining glam rock with his ambiguously
                        sexy Ziggy Stardust persona. Ziggy made Bowie an international star, yet he wasn't content
                        to continue to churn out glitter rock. By the mid-'70s,
                        he developed an effete, sophisticated version of Philly soul that he dubbed "plastic soul,"
                        which eventually morphed into the eerie avant-pop of 1976's Station to Station. Shortly
                        afterward, he relocated to Berlin, where he recorded
                        three experimental electronic albums with Brian Eno. At the dawn of the '80s, Bowie was
                        still at the height of his powers, yet following his blockbuster dance-pop album Let's
                        Dance in 1983, he slowly sank into mediocrity before salvaging
                        his career in the early '90s. Even when he was out of fashion in the '80s and '90s,
                        it was clear that Bowie was one of the most influential musicians in rock, for better and for
                        worse. Each one of his phases in the '70s sparked a
                        number of subgenres, including punk, new wave, goth rock, the new romantics, and electronica.
                        Few rockers ever had such lasting impact.
David Jones began performing music when he was 13
                        years old, learning the saxophone while he was at Bromley
                        Technical High School; another pivotal event happened at the school, when his left pupil became
                        permanently dilated in a schoolyard fight. Following his graduation at 16, he worked as a
                        commercial artist while playing saxophone in a number of mod
                        bands, including the King Bees, the Manish Boys (which also featured Jimmy Page as a session
                        man), and Davey Jones &amp; the Lower Third. All three of those bands released singles, which
                        were generally ignored, yet he continued performing, changing
                        his name to David Bowie in 1966 after the Monkees' Davy Jones became an international star.
                        Over the course of 1966, he released three mod singles on Pye Records, which were all ignored.
                        The following year, he signed with Deram, releasing the
                        music hall, Anthony Newley-styled David Bowie that year. Upon completing the record, he spent
                        several weeks in a Scottish Buddhist monastery. Once he left the monastery, he studied with
                        Lindsay Kemp's mime troupe, forming his own mime company,
                        the Feathers, in 1969. The Feathers were short-lived, and he formed the experimental art group
                        Beckenham Arts Lab in 1969.
Bowie needed to finance the Arts Lab, so he signed with Mercury
                        Records that year and released Man of Words, Man of Music,
                        a trippy singer/songwriter album featuring "Space Oddity." The song was released as a
                        single and became a major hit in the U.K., convincing Bowie to concentrate on music. Hooking up
                        with his old friend Marc Bolan, he began miming at some of
                        Bolan's T. Rex concerts, eventually touring with Bolan, bassist/producer Tony Visconti,
                        guitarist Mick Ronson, and drummer Cambridge as Hype. The band quickly fell apart, yet Bowie and
                        Ronson remained close, working on the material that formed
                        Bowie's next album, The Man Who Sold the World, as well as recruiting Michael "Woody"
                        Woodmansey as their drummer. Produced by Tony Visconti, who also played bass, The Man Who Sold
                        the World was a heavy guitar rock album that failed to
                        gain much attention. Bowie followed the album in late 1971 with the pop/rock Hunky Dory, an
                        album that featured Ronson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman.
Following its release, Bowie began
                        to develop his most famous incarnation, Ziggy Stardust: an
                        androgynous, bisexual rock star from another planet. Before he unveiled Ziggy, Bowie claimed in
                        a January 1972 interview with Melody Maker that he was gay, helping to stir interest in his
                        forthcoming album. Taking cues from Bolan's stylish glam
                        rock, Bowie dyed his hair orange and began wearing women's clothing. He began calling
                        himself Ziggy Stardust, and his backing band -- Ronson, Woodmansey, and bassist Trevor Bolder --
                        were the Spiders from Mars. The Rise and Fall of Ziggy
                        Stardust and the Spiders from Mars was released with much fanfare in England in late 1972. The
                        album and its lavish, theatrical concerts became a sensation throughout England, and it helped
                        him become the only glam rocker to carve out a niche in
                        America. Ziggy Stardust became a word-of-mouth hit in the U.S., and the re-released "Space
                        Oddity" -- which was now also the title of the re-released Man of Words, Man of Music --
                        reached the American Top 20. Bowie quickly followed Ziggy
                        with Aladdin Sane later in 1973. Not only did he record a new album that year, but he also
                        produced Lou Reed's Transformer, the Stooges' Raw Power, and Mott the Hoople's
                        comeback All the Young Dudes, for which he also wrote the title
                        track.
Given the amount of work Bowie packed into 1972 and 1973, it wasn't surprising
                        that his relentless schedule began to catch up with him. After recording the all-covers Pin-Ups
                        with the Spiders from Mars, he unexpectedly announced the
                        band's breakup, as well as his retirement from live performances, during the group's
                        final show that year. He retreated from the spotlight to work on a musical adaptation of George
                        Orwell's 1984, but once he was denied the rights to
                        the novel, he transformed the work into Diamond Dogs. The album was released to generally poor
                        reviews in 1974, yet it generated the hit single "Rebel Rebel," and he supported the
                        album with an elaborate and expensive American tour. As the
                        tour progressed, Bowie became fascinated with soul music, eventually redesigning the entire show
                        to reflect his new "plastic soul." Hiring guitarist Carlos Alomar as the band's
                        leader, Bowie refashioned his group into a Philly soul
                        band and recostumed himself in sophisticated, stylish fashions. The change took fans by
                        surprise, as did the double-album David Live, which featured material recorded on the 1974 tour.
Young
                        Americans, released in 1975, was the culmination of
                        Bowie's soul obsession, and it became his first major crossover hit, peaking in the
                        American Top Ten and generating his first U.S. number one hit in "Fame," a song he
                        co-wrote with John Lennon and Alomar. Bowie relocated to Los
                        Angeles, where he earned his first movie role in Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth
                        (1976). While in L.A., he recorded Station to Station, which took the plastic soul of Young
                        Americans into darker, avant-garde-tinged directions, yet was
                        also a huge hit, generating the Top Ten single "Golden Years." The album inaugurated
                        Bowie's persona of the elegant "Thin White Duke," and it reflected Bowie's
                        growing cocaine-fueled paranoia. Soon, he decided Los
                        Angeles was too boring and returned to England; shortly after arriving back in London, he gave
                        the awaiting crowd a Nazi salute, a signal of his growing, drug-addled detachment from reality.
                        The incident caused enormous controversy, and Bowie left
                        the country to settle in Berlin, where he lived and worked with Brian Eno.
Once in Berlin,
                        Bowie sobered up and began painting, as well as studying art. He also developed a fascination
                        with German electronic music, which Eno helped him fulfill on
                        their first album together, Low. Released early in 1977, Low was a startling mixture of
                        electronics, pop, and avant-garde technique. While it was greeted with mixed reviews at the
                        time, it proved to be one of the most influential albums of the late
                        '70s, as did its follow-up, Heroes, which followed that year. Not only did Bowie record two
                        solo albums in 1977, but he also helmed Iggy Pop's comeback records The Idiot and Lust for
                        Life, and toured anonymously as Pop's keyboardist.
                        He resumed his acting career in 1977, appearing in Just a Gigolo with Marlene Dietrich and Kim
                        Novak, as well as narrating Eugene Ormandy's version of Peter and the Wolf. Bowie returned
                        to the stage in 1978, launching an international tour that
                        was captured on the double-album Stage. During 1979, Bowie and Eno recorded Lodger in New York,
                        Switzerland, and Berlin, releasing the album at the end of the year. Lodger was supported with
                        several innovative videos, as was 1980's Scary
                        Monsters, and these videos -- "DJ," "Fashion," "Ashes to Ashes" --
                        became staples on early MTV.
Scary Monsters was Bowie's last album for RCA, and it
                        wrapped up his most innovative, productive period. Later in
                        1980, he performed the title role in stage production of The Elephant Man, including several
                        shows on Broadway. Over the next two years, he took an extended break from recording, appearing
                        in Christiane F (1981) and the vampire movie The Hunger
                        (1982), returning to the studio only for his 1981 collaboration with Queen, "Under
                        Pressure," and the theme for Paul Schrader's remake of Cat People. In 1983, he signed
                        an expensive contract with EMI Records and released Let's
                        Dance. Bowie had recruited Chic guitarist Nile Rodgers to produce the album, giving the record a
                        sleek, funky foundation, and hired the unknown Stevie Ray Vaughan as lead guitarist. Let's
                        Dance became his most successful record, thanks to
                        stylish, innovative videos for "Let's Dance" and "China Girl," which
                        turned both songs into Top Ten hits. Bowie supported the record with the sold-out arena tour
                        Serious Moonlight.
Greeted with massive success for the
                        first time, Bowie wasn't quite sure how to react, and he eventually decided to replicate
                        Let's Dance with 1984's Tonight. While the album sold well, producing the Top Ten hit
                        "Blue Jean," it received poor reviews and was
                        ultimately a commercial disappointment. He stalled in 1985, recording a duet of Martha &amp; the
                        Vandellas' "Dancing in the Street" with Mick Jagger for Live Aid. He also spent
                        more time jet-setting, appearing at celebrity events
                        across the globe, and appeared in several movies -- Into the Night (1985), Absolute Beginners
                        (1986), Labyrinth (1986) -- that turned out to be bombs. Bowie returned to recording in 1987
                        with the widely panned Never Let Me Down, supporting the album
                        with the Glass Spider tour, which also received poor reviews. In 1989, he remastered his RCA
                        catalog with Rykodisc for CD release, kicking off the series with the three-disc box Sound +
                        Vision. Bowie supported the discs with an accompanying tour of
                        the same name, claming that he was retiring all of his older characters from performance
                        following the tour. Sound + Vision was successful, and Ziggy Stardust re-charted amidst the
                        hoopla.
Sound + Vision may have been a success, but Bowie's
                        next project was perhaps his most unsuccessful. Picking up on the abrasive, dissonant rock of
                        Sonic Youth and the Pixies, Bowie formed his own guitar rock combo, Tin Machine, with guitarist
                        Reeves Gabrels, bassist Hunt Sales, and his drummer brother
                        Tony, who had previously worked on Iggy Pop's Lust for Life with Bowie. Tin Machine
                        released an eponymous album to poor reviews that summer and supported it with a club tour, which
                        was only moderately successful. Despite the poor reviews, Tin
                        Machine released a second album, the appropriately titled Tin Machine II, in 1991, and it was
                        completely ignored.
Bowie returned to a solo career in 1993 with the sophisticated, soulful
                        Black Tie White Noise, recording the album with Nile Rodgers
                        and his now-permanent collaborator, Reeves Gabrels. The album was released on Savage, a
                        subsidiary of RCA, and received positive reviews, but his new label went bankrupt shortly after
                        its release, and the album disappeared. Black Tie White Noise was
                        the first indication that Bowie was trying hard to resuscitate his career, as was the largely
                        instrumental 1994 soundtrack The Buddha of Suburbia. In 1995, he reunited with Brian Eno for the
                        wildly hyped, industrial rock-tinged Outside. Several
                        critics hailed the album as a comeback, and Bowie supported it with a co-headlining tour with
                        Nine Inch Nails in order to snag a younger, alternative audience, but his gambit failed;
                        audiences left before Bowie's performance and Outside
                        disappeared. He quickly returned to the studio in 1996, recording Earthling, an album heavily
                        influenced by techno and drum'n'bass. Upon its early 1997 release, Earthling received
                        generally positive reviews, yet the album failed to gain an
                        audience, and many techno purists criticized Bowie for allegedly exploiting their subculture.
                        hours... followed in 1999. For 2002, Bowie reunited with producer Toni Visconti and released
                        Heathen to very positive reviews. He continued on with Visconti
                        for Reality in 2003, which was once again warmly received.
Bowie supported Reality with a
                        lengthy tour but it came to a halt in the summer of 2004 when he received an emergency
                        angioplasty while in Hamburg, Germany. Following this health scare,
                        Bowie quietly retreated from the public eye. Over the next few years, he popped up at the
                        occasional charity concert or gala event and he sometimes sang in the studio for other artists
                        (notably he appeared on Scarlett Johansson's Tom Waits
                        tribute Anywhere I Lay My Head in 2008). Archival releases appeared but no new recordings did
                        until he suddenly ended his unofficial retirement on his 66th birthday on January 8, 2013,
                        releasing a new single called "Where Are We Now?" and
                        announcing the arrival of a new album. Entitled The Next Day and once again produced by
                        Visconti, that album was released in March of 2013. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi &lt;a

The

					<content>""Heroes"" is an album by David Bowie, released in 1977.

The
                        second installment of his "Berlin Trilogy" with Brian Eno (the other releases being
                        "Low" and "Lodger")
                        "Heroes" developed the sound of "Low" in a more positive direction. Of the

                        one wholly recorded there.

The title track remains
                        one of Bowie's best known, a classic story of two lovers who meet at the Berlin Wall. The
                        album is considered one of his best by critics, notably for the contributions of guitarist
                        Robert Fripp who flew in from the U.S. to record his parts in
                        one day. John Lennon was quoted as saying that when making his album "Double Fantasy"
                        in 1980, his ambition was to "do something as good as "Heroes". It was named NME
                        Album of the Year.

                        “China Girl” was a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the
                        latter’s 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a
                        rerecorded version of the song “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” which had been a minor hit for
                        Bowie a year earlier. Let’s Dance is also notable as a stepping stone for the career of the
                        Texas blues guitar virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on
                        it. The album was also released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let’s Dance has sold
                        over 10 and a half million copies worldwide, making it Bowie’s best-selling album.

Songs
                        and album development:
Bowie, having just signed
                        with EMI records for a reported $17.5m, worked with Nile Rodgers to release a “commercially
                        buoyant” new album that was described as “original party-funk cum big bass drum sound greater
                        than the sum of its influences.” The album’s influences were
                        described as Louis Jordan, the Asbury Jukes horn section, Bill Doggett, Earl Bostic and James
                        Brown. Bowie spent a mere three days making demos for the album in New York before cutting the
                        album, a rarity for Bowie who, for the previous few albums,
                        usually showed up with little more than “a few ideas.” Despite this, the album “was recorded,
                        start to finish, including mixing, in 17 days” according to Rodgers.

Stevie Ray
                        Vaughan, who met Bowie at the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival, when
                        discussing the album, said “to tell you the truth, I was not very familiar with David’s music
                        when he asked me to play on the sessions. … David and I talked for hours and hours about our
                        music, about funky Texas blues and its roots – I was amazed at
                        how interested he was. At Montreux, he said something about being in touch and then tracked me
                        down in California, months and months later.”

Unusually, Bowie played no instruments on
                        the album. “I don’t play a damned thing. This was a
                        singer’s album.”

A few years later, Bowie discussed his feelings on the track
                        “Ricochet” (which Musician magazine called an “incendiary ballroom raveup”) from this album:

“I
                        thought it was a great song, and the beat wasn’t quite
                        right. It didn’t roll the way it should have, the syncopation was wrong. It had an ungainly
                        gait; it should have flowed. … Nile [Rodgers] did his own thing to it, but it wasn’t quite what
                        I’d had in mind when I wrote the thing.”

The album
                        was generally positively reviewed by critics and well received by fans, with at least one
                        reviewer calling it “Bowie at his best.”

The success of the album surprised Bowie. In
                        1997, he said “at the time, Let’s Dance was not mainstream. It
                        was virtually a new kind of hybrid, using blues-rock guitar against a dance format. There wasn’t
                        anything else that really quite sounded like that at the time. So it only seems commercial in
                        hindsight because it sold so many [copies]. It was great in
                        its way, but it put me in a real corner in that it fucked with my integrity.”

In fact,
                        Bowie would later state that the success of the album caused him to hit a creative low-point in
                        his career which lasted the next few years. “I remember
                        looking out over these waves of people [who were coming to hear this record played live] and
                        thinking, ‘I wonder how many Velvet Underground albums these people have in their record
                        collections?’ I suddenly felt very apart from my audience. And it
                        was depressing, because I didn’t know what they wanted.”

					<summary>Low is the eleventh studio album by British musician David Bowie, co-produced by Bowie and
                        Tony Visconti.

Widely regarded as one of Bowie's most influential releases, Low
                        was the first of the "Berlin Trilogy", a
                        series of collaborations with Brian Eno (though the album was mainly recorded in France and only
                        mixed in West Berlin). The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on "Heroes"
                        and Lodger. The album's working title was

					<content>Low is the eleventh studio album by British musician David Bowie, co-produced by Bowie and
                        Tony Visconti.

Widely regarded as one of Bowie's most influential releases, Low
                        was the first of the "Berlin Trilogy", a
                        series of collaborations with Brian Eno (though the album was mainly recorded in France and only
                        mixed in West Berlin). The experimental, avant-garde style would be further explored on "Heroes"
                        and Lodger. The album's working title was
                        New Music Night and Day.

The genesis of Low lies in both the foundations laid by Bowie's
                        previous album Station to Station, and music he intended for the soundtrack to The Man Who Fell
                        to Earth. When Bowie presented his material for the
                        film to Nicolas Roeg, the director decided that it would not be suitable. Roeg preferred a more
                        folksy sound, although John Phillips (the chosen composer for the soundtrack) described Bowie's
                        contributions as "haunting and beautiful".
                        Elements from these pieces were incorporated into Low instead. The album's cover, like
                        Station to Station, is a still from the movie: the photographic image, under the album's
                        title, formed a deliberate pun on the phrase "low
                        profile".

In
                        2005, Seu Jorge did a cover album of 14 Bowie songs, many of them from Ziggy Stardust, as a
                        soundtrack for the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou
                        called The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions. The translation into Portuguese is not always exact, as
                        Seu Jorge maintains the melodies and styles, but often varies the lyrics. Musician Saul Williams
                        named his 2007, Trent Reznor produced album The
                        Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, clearly in a nod to Bowies album.

Bowie
                        claimed that the name came from a tailor's shop in London called Ziggy's. Bowie later
                        told Rolling Stone it was "one of the few Christian
                        names I could find beginning with the letter 'Z'." "Stardust" comes
                        from one of Bowie's labelmates, a country singer named Norman Carl Odam, The Legendary
                        Stardust Cowboy. Bowie covered a Legendary Stardust Cowboy song,
                        "I Took a Trip (On a Gemini Spaceship)" thirty years later on Heathen.

The
                        Ziggy Stardust sessions began just a few weeks after Hunky Dory was released. The first song
                        recorded for the album, the cover "It Ain't
                        Easy," was recorded in September 1971. The first session in November produced "Hang on
                        to Yourself," "Ziggy Stardust," "Rock 'n' Roll Star" (later
                        shortened to "Star"), "Moonage
                        Daydream," "Soul Love," "Lady Stardust," and "Five Years."

Also
                        recorded during the November Ziggy Sessions were two more cover songs intended for the as-yet
                        untitled album. They were Chuck Berry's
                        "Around and Around" (re-titled "Round and Round") and Jacques Brel's
                        "Amsterdam" (re-titled "Port of Amsterdam"). A re-recording of "Holy
                        Holy" (first recorded in 1970 and released as a single,
                        to poor sales, in January 1971) was initially slated for Ziggy, but was dropped in favour of
                        "Rock 'n' Roll Suicide." "Round and Round" was replaced by "Starman"
                        and "It Ain't Easy" replaced
                        "Amsterdam" on the album's final running order. All three were eventually
                        released as b-sides.

"Velvet Goldmine," first recorded during the Hunky Dory
                        sessions, was also intended for Ziggy, but was replaced by
                        "Suffragette City." RCA released it in 1975 as the b-side to the UK re-release of
                        "Space Oddity" after having it remixed and mastered without Bowie's approval.

After
                        recording some of the new songs for Sounds of the
                        70s with Bob Harris (which appear on Bowie at the Beeb) as the newly-dubbed Spiders from Mars in
                        January-February 1972, the band returned to Trident. They recorded "Starman," "Suffragette
                        City," and "Rock 'n' Roll
                        Suicide" by the end of the month.

"Starman," released as a single in
                        April (and not intended for the final album at first), has never appeared in its original "loud"
                        mix on CD. It differs somewhat in that it
                        "features a subdued 'morse code' section between the verse and the chorus"
                        compared to the original released in 1972. "Starman"'s b-side, "Suffragette
                        City," was mastered for the album with a three-note
                        coda leading in from "Ziggy Stardust" to make the songs sound linked. They were never
                        played as such by Bowie in concert.

Recorded and released during the ensuing Ziggy tour
                        were two other songs. The first, "John, I'm
                        Only Dancing," was recorded at Trident in late June and released (in the UK only) in
                        September. "The Jean Genie," recorded at RCA Studios in New York in early October at
                        the start of the American tour, was released in the U.S. in
                        November. The song was remixed for Aladdin Sane.

Rock keyboardist Rick Wakeman was
                        given the opportunity to play keyboards on the album but Rick opted to join the progressive rock
                        group Yes instead.

The album was intended by Bowie
                        to serve as the soundtrack and musical basis for a stage show and/or television production
                        telling the story of Ziggy Stardust. As well as the songs on the album, Bowie also intended
                        songs such as "All the Young Dudes", "Rebel
                        Rebel" and "Rock 'n' Roll With Me" (the latter two later recorded for
                        Diamond Dogs) for this realization of the Ziggy story. In a Rolling Stone interview with William
                        S. Burroughs, Bowie outlined the full plot of the Ziggy
                        Stardust story:

"The time is five years to go before the end of the earth. It has
                        been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a
                        position where all the kids have access to things that they
                        thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on
                        their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock-and-roll band and the kids no longer want
                        rock-and-roll. There's no electricity to play it.
                        Ziggy's adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, 'cause there is no news. So
                        Ziggy does this and there is terrible news. 'All the young dudes' is a song about this
                        news. It's no hymn to the youth as people thought. It
                        is completely the opposite.

The end comes when the infinites arrive. They really are a
                        black hole, but I've made them people because it would be very hard to explain a black hole
                        on stage.

Ziggy is advised in a dream by the
                        infinites to write the coming of a Starman, so he writes 'Starman', which is the first
                        news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately...The starmen that he
                        is talking about are called the infinites, and they are
                        black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down
                        to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in Greenwich Village. They don't have a care in
                        the world and are of no possible use to us. They just
                        happened to stumble into our universe by black hole jumping. Their whole life is travelling from
                        universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles Brando, another one is a Black
                        New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie, the Infinite
                        Fox...Now Ziggy starts to believe in all this himself and thinks himself a prophet of the future
                        starmen. He takes himself up to the incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his
                        disciples. When the infinites arrive, they take bits of Ziggy
                        to make them real because in their original state they are anti-matter and cannot exist in our
                        world. And they tear him to pieces on stage during the song 'Rock 'n' roll
                        suicide'. As soon as Ziggy dies on stage the infinites take
                        his elements and make themselves visible."

The more generally acknowledged story,
                        however, has Ziggy Stardust himself being the "starman", from Mars, who has come to
                        save the Earth with messages of love and peace, and Bowie
                        has referred to Ziggy as a "Martian" in several interviews.

Simple
                        two-syllable phrases provide the spine for "Suffragette City" ("hey man"),
                        "Hang on to Yourself" ("come on"), "Lady
                        Stardust" ("all right"), and "Five Years" ("five years").

"Starman,"
                        the album's single, has been described as a cross between mod and "Somewhere Over the
                        Rainbow".

				<content>David Bowie (born David Robert Jones on 8th January 1947 in Brixton, London, UK) was an English rock singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Active during six decades of popular music and frequently reinventing his music and image, Bowie is
        widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. Shortly after releasing his 25th studio album Blackstar, it was announced Bowie died on 10 January 2016, following an eighteen-month battle with cancer. At the 59th Grammy
        Awards on Sun, February 12, 2017, Bowie took the award for "Best Rock Song" for "Blackstar".

As a multi-instrumentalist, he was famous for playing the guitar, piano, and saxophone, but also plays the harmonica, drums,
        cello, marimba, bass guitar, koto, and stylophone. His first single was released in 1964, but he rose to fame with the 1969 single "Space Oddity" and the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. Subsequent
        albums have explored blue-eyed soul, electronica, and new wave, often pre-dating these genres' popularity or even the point at which they were defined as genres.
 
Bowie was one of the most influential rock musicians from the 1970s to
        the present. He has sold an estimated 136 million albums in his career and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his musical career, Bowie has had success as a painter, web-designer, sculptor, Broadway actor starring
        in The Elephant Man, and film actor starring in many films.
 
Bowie is also credited as being a major inspiration behind the new romantic, futurist movement, and subsequent development of electronic/electronica music.
 
Bowie
        frequently brought the worlds of high art, mime, and straight theatre to his stage acts. His most famous on-stage look was that of Ziggy Stardust; other personae include Halloween Jack, Aladdin Sane, and the Thin White Duke. &lt;a

                        released on September 4, 2012 through Interscope Records. The extended track was released on
                        February 12, 2013, adding three more songs. Recorded between
                        2010 and 2012, the album was primarily produced by the band themselves, as well as English
                        hip-hop producer Alex da Kid and Brandon Darner from the American indie rock group The Envy
                        Corps. It was mastered by Joe LaPorta. According to frontman Dan
                        Reynolds, the album took three years to finish, with six of the album's tracks being
                        previously released on multiple EPs. Musically, Night Visions exhibits influences of folk, hip
                        hop and pop.

The album received generally mixed reviews
                        from music critics upon release. However it debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in the
                        United States, selling more than 83,000 copies within its first week where it has since been
                        certified double Platinum. It also peaked at the summit of the
                        Billboard Alternative Albums and Rock Albums charts, as well as in the top ten albums in
                        Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway,
                        Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom. Night Visions appeared
                        in the Billboard 200 top 10 in 2012, 2013, and 2014. The album became the fourth best-selling
                        album of 2013 in the US. It was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year
                        (2014) and won the Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album
                        (2014).

The band's single "It's Time", which previously appeared on the "It's Time" and "Continued Silence" EPs in addition to appearing on "Night Visions", is the group's
        biggest hit, reaching #33 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In a dark kitchen in the middle of a sweaty night in Las Vegas, all 6’4” of Dan Reynolds is hunched over a laptop, slapping beats on the table and crooning lyrics into a tiny microphone.
        Before long, he and the other three members of indie rock band Imagine Dragons would be playing “It’s Time,” that same laptop-demo-turned-supersized-anthem, from the roof of a parking garage to a wave of thousands of screaming fans. This song title
        to the single from their 2012 debut KidInaKorner/Interscope release “Continued Silence EP” is an all too apt descriptor of the band’s hard-earned success—but it’s also emblematic of the deep-seated anxiety Reynolds and the rest of the band
        experienced leaving behind any realistic expectation of a normal job to do the thing they love most. 

A third-generation Las Vegas native, Reynolds is no stranger to the adage “the house always wins,” choosing to pave his musical career with
        a near obsessive work ethic and hundreds of unused demos rather than roll the dice with the first songs that sprung from his mouth. It’s no surprise, then, that he was drawn to guitarist Wayne Sermon, another founding member of Imagine Dragons.
        Having practically grown up in a recording studio and graduated Berklee College of Music, Wayne had been practicing his guitar through meals and other socially inappropriate situations as long as he could remember; he challenged Dan in a way that was
        both uncomfortable and exactly what they both needed. When they began writing songs together and recognized something special was happening, Wayne called up his Berklee friend Ben McKee, who promptly dropped out of school with only a few credits
        left, moving across the country to play bass for the band. This sort of reckless/genius behavior is typical for Ben, who has an uncanny penchant for spicy food and a suitcase full of unbelievable road stories. More recently, the band was joined by
        drummer Daniel Platzman, another Bostonian schoolmate who seems way too nice to be playing rock and roll until you actually see him in action.

Several tours and three self-released EPs later, Imagine Dragons had made a serious name for
        itself, particularly in the west coast circuit. Although their songs vary from nearly whimsical and light to brooding and powerful, listeners are drawn to the inherent honesty in the music. The only rule of thumb for the band, it seems, is to write
        from a true place; the result is songs that literally run the spectrum of human emotion. Attend a concert, and it becomes clear that the live performance of deeply personal songs has a real effect on people. And the band itself is not immune, as
        demonstrated when Dan literally passed out into the drum set during a finale song, sending cymbals and drum stands crashing while the rest of the band played on until the close.

Great songwriting is bound to be noticed eventually. As proof
        that the harder you work, the luckier you get, one of those people who noticed was Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid (Eminem, Rihanna). Alex and Dan began collaborating on projects, and soon the band had developed a relationship with Alex and his
        team. The alchemy resulting from Alex’s hip hop sensibilities and Imagine Dragons’ anthemic rock is nothing short of explosive. The byproduct of this creative collision is “Continued Silence,” a six song in-your-face sonic grenade that breaks musical
        boundaries and yet is strangely relatable by its improbably diverse audience. 

Despite it all, on any given day when they aren’t on the road playing shows, you can still find Imagine Dragons huddled away in a rehearsal room somewhere,
        banging out song after song in search of the next perfect track. Like most things in Vegas, the band is angled at going big or going bust. For the sake of those who love great music, we hope it’s the former.

                        selling 3.7m copies in USA, and as of April 2015, it had
                        sold 4.5m copies in the US (9m worldwide). The first single from "1989", Shake It Off",
                        released on August 18, 2014, reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Commentators described
                        the album as being synthpop and reminiscent of

					<content>Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released
                        on October 22, 2012 through Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her commercially successful
                        2010 album Speak Now. It was announced through
                        Swift's live webchat on August 13, 2012, in which she revealed the album title, album
                        cover, as well as answered fan questions. Four promotional singles were released in the month
                        leading up to the album release, three of which debuted inside
                        the top ten of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album features collaborations with new producers
                        and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, and sees Swift experimenting with new
                        musical genres.

The album's lead single,
                        "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" was a worldwide commercial success, topping
                        the iTunes charts all over the world and sold 623,000 copies in the first week, becoming Swift's
                        first ever Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper after
                        vaulting from 72 to number one and stayed at top for three weeks. Even though she usually doesn't
                        discuss who her songs are about, Swift told Broadway's Electric Barnyard that she would
                        agree to disclose the inspiration for "We Are
                        Never Ever Getting Back Together" for a six figure donation to charity. Following in the
                        footsteps of one of her idol's, whom she mimics quite often, Carly Simon.

The
                        second single, "Begin Again" was released in October
                        1. Red has also spawned three other promotional singles, all of them reached top 15 on the
                        Billboard Hot 100 chart. Red has been mostly acclaimed by music critics, who praised Swift's
                        versatility as a musician and enjoyed her experiments with
                        new music genres. Red sold 1,208,000 copies in its first week in the U.S, debuting at number one
                        on the Billboard 200 chart, and scored the highest number one debut in the US for the 2010s
                        decade so far. Red is also Swift's first chart-topper in
                        the U.K., and also topped the album charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. &lt;a

					<content>Taylor Swift is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released
                        on October 24, 2006, by Big Machine Records. Swift was 16 years old at the time of the album's
                        release and wrote its songs during her freshman
                        year of high school. Swift has writing credits on all of the album's songs, including those
                        co-written with Liz Rose. Swift experimented with several producers, ultimately choosing Nathan
                        Chapman, who had produced her demo album. Musically, the
                        album is country music styled, and lyrically it speaks of romantic relationships, a couple of
                        which Swift wrote from observing relationships before being in one. Lyrics also touch on Swift's
                        personal struggles in high school.

Five
                        singles were released from the album, all of which have been certified platinum by the RIAA.
                        "Tim McGraw" was released as the lead single and reached the top ten on Billboard's
                        Hot Country Songs. "Teardrops on My Guitar" was
                        released as the second single and was the album's best-charting song on the Billboard Hot
                        100. "Our Song" was released as the third single from the album and was Swift's
                        first number one on Billboard's Hot Country Songs
                        chart. It made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number one song on
                        the Hot Country Songs chart. "Picture to Burn" and "Should've Said No"
                        were released as the fourth single and fifth singles from
                        the album, respectively, and both were successful on the country charts in the United States.
                        Swift promoted the album by performing on tour as the opening act for artists such as Rascal
                        Flatts, George Strait, Brad Paisley, and Tim McGraw and Faith
                        Hill.

Taylor Swift was received positively by contemporary critics, who praised Swift's
                        talent at such a young age. The album enjoyed commercial success and launched Swift's
                        career in country music. In the United States, it topped
                        the Top Country Albums Chart for 24 non-consecutive weeks, and was certified five times platinum
                        by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 5 million copies.
                        Taylor Swift has logged 275 weeks on the Billboard Top 200
                        chart as of early 2013. The album was also successful outside of Swift's native country,
                        especially in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The album has sold over 6 million
                        copies worldwide as of January 2015. &lt;a

				<content>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989 in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania) is an American pop singer-songwriter and actress. Swift is a 10-time Grammy winner with a total of 23 nominations (Feb 2016). 

In 2006, she released her debut
        single "Tim McGraw", then her self-titled debut album, which was subsequently certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

In November 2008, Swift released her second album, Fearless, which featured a
        number of more pop oriented songs such as "You Belong With Me" and "Love Story". Fearless was the best-selling album in 2009 in the USA and was awarded with 4 Grammy's.

Swift's third and fourth albums,
        2010's "Speak Now" and 2012's "Red", both sold over one million copies within the first week of their US release. “Speak Now” won two Grammy Awards, while “Red’s” singles " We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
        " and " I Knew You Were Trouble" were worldwide hits.

The 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. It marked a move away from her earlier country sounds and fully into pop. Both the title ("1989") and the overall sound
        of the album - synth pop - were a nod to her birth year and nostalgia with the 1980s. It became the best-selling album of 2014, selling 3.66m copies in USA, and as of April 2015, it had sold 4.5m copies in the US (9m worldwide). The first single from
        the album was "Shake It Off" (released on August 18, 2014), which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100.

On February 15, 2016, Taylor Swift won "album of the year" at the 58th Grammy Awards for
        "1989".

					<content>A Thousand Suns is the fourth studio album by American rock band Linkin Park. It was
                        released on September 8, 2010, under Warner Bros. Records. The album was written by the band,
                        while production was handled by Linkin Park vocalist Mike
                        Shinoda and Rick Rubin who previously worked together to produce the band's third studio
                        album Minutes to Midnight (2007). Recording sessions for the album took place at NRG Recording
                        Studios in North Hollywood, California from 2008 until early
                        2010.

A Thousand Suns is a multi-concept album dealing with human fears such as nuclear
                        warfare. The band has acknowledged that the album is a drastic departure from their previous
                        work, as they experimented on different and new sounds for A
                        Thousand Suns. Shinoda stated in an interview with MTV that the album references numerous social
                        issues, as well as blending human ideas with technology. The album's title comes from the
                        Hindu Sanskrit scripture, the Bhagavad Gita: "If the
                        radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor
                        of the mighty one," a quote made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic
                        bomb, which references the numerous apocalyptic themes of
                        the album.

The lead single for the album, "The Catalyst", was sent to radio
                        and released to digital music retailers on August 2, 2010. "The Catalyst" peaked at
                        the Billboard Alternative Songs and Rock Songs charts, as
                        well as reaching #27 at the Billboard Hot 100 upon the album's release. Three more singles
                        were released to promote the album, namely "Waiting for the End", "Burning in the
                        Skies" and "Iridescent". "The
                        Catalyst" and "Waiting for the End" have been both certified gold by the RIAA.
                        The band promoted the album through the A Thousand Suns World Tour from October 2010 to
                        September 2011.

Upon release, the album was met with
                        positive reviews, but it polarized critics and fans over the band's new direction. Despite
                        this, the album has been a commercial success debuting at number one on over ten charts. The
                        album has been certified gold by the RIAA on February 2011
                        and has sold 840,000 copies in the United States as of April 2012. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/A+Thousand+Suns"&gt;Read

                        makes it the band's best-selling album, the second best-selling album of the 21st century
                        so far, and the second best selling debut album. It is also one of the few albums to be
                        certified Diamond in the U.S. that was released in this century.
                        

Recorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don
                        Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington
                        experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the
                        constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous
                        name of the band.

Four singles were released from the album: "One Step Closer",
                        "Papercut", "In the End", and the
                        Grammy Award-winning "Crawling", which along with "In the End" was
                        responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. At the 2002 Grammy Awards,
                        Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album.

Hybrid
                        Theory was released in the United States on October 24, 2000 following the debut of "One
                        Step Closer" on the radio. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 charts at #16 in late 2000,
                        and was certified gold by the RIAA five weeks after its
                        release. In 2001, Hybrid Theory sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the
                        best-selling album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000
                        copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years,
                        the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 for
                        selling 10 million copies in the U.S. In 2007, it has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S.
                        alone. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009,
                        including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album and the
                        best-selling debut album of the 21st century.

Critical opinion for Hybrid Theory was
                        mixed. Some critics gave the album positive reviews;
                        Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a "far more complex and
                        talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late", and claimed that "they will
                        continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard
                        sounds." Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory four out of five stars. Robert Christgau of The
                        Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the
                        album a "two-star honorable mention rating", citing
                        "Papercut" and "Points of Authority" as highlights of the album. Jenny
                        Eliscu of Rolling Stone commented that Hybrid Theory had "as much potency as albums by Limp
                        Bizkit or Korn" and called it an album that
                        "reflects the frustration of life".

Other critics, however, dismissed the
                        album. Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann said that "Linkin Park sounds like a
                        Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style" and called
                        "One Step Closer" "a typical effort", referring to the lyrics of the song's
                        chorus. NME's Noel Gardner commented that "otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers
                        like 'With You' and 'A Place for My
                        Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching," giving the album a score
                        of six out of ten.




Despite initially mixed reviews, Hybrid Theory found
                        itself in several “must have” lists that were compiled by
                        various music publications, networks, and other media. Some of the more prominent of these lists

					<content>Living Things is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Linkin Park. It was
                        released under Warner Bros. Records and Machine Shop Recordings on June 20, 2012, in Japan, and
                        throughout the rest of the world during the following week.
                        Production was handled by vocalist Mike Shinoda and Rick Rubin, who both co-produced the band's
                        previous two studio albums Minutes to Midnight (2007) and A Thousand Suns (2010).

The
                        band states that Living Things combines elements from
                        their previous four studio albums to create a new sound. They stated they finally felt they were
                        in "familiar territory" and "comfortable in [their] own skin" after years of
                        experimentation that resulted in their two previous
                        studio albums, Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns. Living Things was chosen as the album's
                        title because of the numerous personal topics on the album.

The lead single for the
                        album, "Burn It Down", was sent to radio and
                        released to digital music retailers on April 16, 2012. Living Things debuted at number one on
                        Billboard 200 with sales of 223,000 copies in the United States in its opening week.

Living
                        Things received mixed reviews from music critics.
                        According to review aggregator website Metacritic, it has an average review score of 60 out of
                        100, based on reviews from 15 professional critics. Chad Childers of Loudwire gave the album a 4
                        out of 5 stars, stating that "the album as a whole
                        continues to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but
                        it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory."

					<content>Meteora is the second studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released on March 25,
                        2003. Following the collaboration album Reanimation which featured remixes of their debut album
                        Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park released singles from
                        Meteora for over a year, including "Somewhere I Belong", "Faint", "Lying
                        from You", "From the Inside", "Breaking the Habit" and "Numb".

It
                        is the most successful album in the
                        history of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative
                        rock songs. "Numb" was the biggest song of the year on the chart. The album has sold
                        over 5 million copies in the United States, and over 16
                        million worldwide to date.

The album was named after the Meteora rock formation in
                        Greece. After seeing these monasteries on a trip to Europe, the band was inspired by the way
                        they were built, almost defying gravity. It was this feeling of
                        greatness and awesome accomplishment that Linkin Park wished to convey with their music, thus
                        the name.

Don Gilmore co-produced the album. Linkin Park comprehensively rehearsed the
                        album, recording more than 40 choruses for the first single
                        "Somewhere I Belong". Like the band's first full-length Hybrid Theory, Meteora
                        was recorded using multitrack recording methods in which each instrument is recorded
                        individually rather than played all at once, as is done in a typical
                        studio setting. In its first week it sold an estimated 810,000 units. To date, it has well over
                        4 million copies in the U.S. alone, nearly 16 million copies worldwide.

The music in
                        Meteora represents significant changes since the release of
                        Hybrid Theory. It is characterized by more relevant influences from rap metal ("Lying from
                        You", "Hit the Floor", "Faint", "Figure.09", "Nobody's
                        Listening"). Their instrumental song
                        "Session" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in
                        2003. "Nobody's Listening" featured a small sample from the band's track,
                        "High Voltage", which appeared on the B-side of One
                        Step Closer and the bonus disc of Hybrid Theory. The sample was a distorted version of Mike
                        rapping, "Coming at you from every side" which comes from the chorus of High Voltage.

The
                        instrumental track "Session" was
                        featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded and on the Season Five Sopranos
                        episode "In Camelot". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Meteora"&gt;Read

					<content>Minutes to Midnight is the third studio album by American rock band Linkin Park, released
                        on May 14, 2007 through Warner Bros. Records This album showed some change of genre of linkin
                        park from nu metal to other experimental genres. The

                        copies worldwide in its first four weeks of release. It is their first studio album with a
                        Parental Advisory label.

The album debuted at number one in
                        the United States and in 15 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, around the
                        world. In the United States, the album had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time,
                        with 625,000 albums sold. The album reached number
                        twenty-five on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007. The album has sold more
                        than 8 millions copies worldwide as of October, 2009. The album is named in reference to the
                        Doomsday Clock.

Minutes to Midnight was delayed
                        several times before its release. First scheduled for Summer of 2006, then Fall of 2006, then
                        early 2007, the album's release date was finally set for May 15, 2007. In an interview in
                        September 2006, Shinoda explained: "When songs are
                        pouring out you don't ever want to stop that. We already have over 100 roughs for songs. We've
                        narrowed it down since but we're not ready to commit to those yet."

From the
                        late stages of the demo sessions, the song
                        "QWERTY", which was rumored to be on Minutes to Midnight, appeared on the Linkin Park
                        Underground v6.0 CD on December 5, 2006 in both live and studio demo versions.

"This
                        was a year-and-a-half long process of really hard work
                        and experimentation in the studio that yielded about 150 rough songs," guitarist Brad
                        Delson told Billboard.com. "Not only is this album incredibly diverse, but the depth of the
                        material is really strong."

The first single,
                        "What I've Done", was released April 2, 2007, and debuted at number one on the
                        United States Modern Rock chart.

"Given Up", "What I've Done"
                        and "No More Sorrow" made their live debut on
                        April 28, 2007 in Berlin. Live performances of these three songs at the Sessions@AOL were
                        released on AOL on May 5, 2007.

On May 12, 2007, Linkin Park played "Bleed It Out"
                        on Saturday Night Live, along with "What I've
                        Done". Also, on May 18, 2007, Linkin Park appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and again
                        performed "What I've Done" and "Bleed It Out".

On January 16,
                        2008, "Valentine's Day" finally made its live
                        debut in Hannover, Germany.

SONGFACTS

1
Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington on In
                        Pieces: "I got divorced recently and that was very
                        difficult. I also got remarried so there was a big contrast in my life. For a while I couldn't
                        be completely happy with the new life I was starting and I couldn't end the last one. This
                        is a song about all of that."

2.THE
                        LITTLE THINGS YOU GIVE AWAY
This song deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and its
                        effect on the city of New Orleans. The band finished this song after visiting New Orleans after
                        the hurricane hit. (thanks, Bronte - Wrexham,
                        Wales)

This is one of the few Linkin Park songs with a guitar solo. (thanks, Jake -
                        Albuquerque, NM)

Guitarist Brad Delson in Kerrang! magazine: "This is our favorite
                        song on the record. It's the biggest statement that
                        we've ever made. Nothing could go after it as everything would get eclipsed by it, that's
                        why it's at the end."

Singer Mike Shinoda in the same Kerrang! interview:
                        "Brad has always avoided solos because he
                        doesn't like to show off. But when he played that solo, though, it was one of the most
                        emotional moments we've recorded. It says what the lyrics are saying without any words."

                        BLEED IT OUT

Linkin Park singer Mike
                        Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "I wrote the lyrics to this about 100 times. it's always
                        frustrating as a lyricist to come in with a new version that you spent hours on and have the
                        band tell you that it's not there yet. in one case,
                        they listened to my lyrics for 30 seconds and told me to start over again. that was pretty hard.
                        it felt like I was bringing in the lyrics, getting punched in the face and then going back to
                        the drawing board. When it finally came together I said to
                        the band 'I don't think anyone but us could have made a song like this'. It's
                        a f--king bizarre death-party-rap-hoedown!"

4.WHAT I'VE DONE 

In
                        this song, Chester Bennington sings about things we've
                        done that we regret - how we want to forget it all and move on. According to Bennington, the
                        theme of the song is "admitting to your faults of the past and kind of accepting it and
                        moving on and trying to become something
                        better."

The album title Minutes To Midnight refers to military terms of nuclear
                        warfare, otherwise known as the Doomsday Clock. It is a political statement, but could also
                        indicate the pressure the band was under to finish the album.
                        (thanks, Steven - Anderson, CA, for above 2)

Rick Rubin produced this track, and
                        stripped Linkin Park's sound down to give them a more raw feel. Rubin did something similar
                        in his work with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. (thanks,
                        Bertrand - Paris, France)

Mike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: "On the other albums,
                        Brad (Delson) and I started every song together (separately). But this was the only song that we
                        wrote together and was the last one we finished. We
                        wanted a song that encapsulated the feel of the whole record and I think this is that song. You're
                        going to get something different out of every time you listen to it."

This debuted
                        at #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart April 12th
                        2007. "What I've Done" was the third song in this tally's 19-year existence
                        to begin its chart life at #1. The other two were R.E.M.'s "What's the Frequency,
                        Kenneth?" and Red Hot Chili Peppers' "Dani
                        California."

The album Minutes To Midnight went to #1 in 28 of the countries in
                        which it was released. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Minutes+to+Midnight"&gt;Read

				<content>Linkin Park is an American band from Agoura Hills, California. Formed in 1996 the band rose to international fame with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which was certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005 and multi-platinum in several other
        countries. Its following studio album, Meteora, continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by extensive touring and charity work around the world. In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth
        greatest band of the music video era and the third best of the new millennium behind Oasis and Coldplay.

Having adapted the nu metal and rap metal genres to a radio-friendly yet densely layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora, the band
        explored other genres in their next studio album, Minutes to Midnight, which was released in 2007. The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third best debut week of any album that year. The band has collaborated with several other artists,
        most notably with rapper Jay-Z in their mashup EP Collision Course, and many others included on Reanimation. The band's most recent studio album, A Thousand Suns, was released on September 8, 2010. Linkin Park has sold over 50 million albums
        worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards. 

Charity:
On January 19, 2010, Linkin Park released a new song titled Not Alone as part of a compilation from Music for Relief called Download to Donate for Haiti in support of the Haiti
        Earthquake crisis. On February 10, 2010, Linkin Park released the official music video for the song on their homepage. The single itself was released on October 21, 2011.

On January 11, 2011, an updated version of Download to Donate for
        Haiti was launched, called Download to Donate for Haiti V2.0, with more songs to download. For the updated compilation, the band released Keaton Hashimoto's remix of The Catalyst from the "Linkin Park featuring YOU"
        contest.

Shinoda designed two t-shirts, in which the proceeds will go to Music for Relief to help the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami disasters. Music For Relief released Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan, another
        compilation of songs, in which the proceeds will go to Save the Children. The band released the song titled as Issho Ni, meaning "we're in this together", on March 22, 2011 via Download to Donate: Tsunami Relief Japan.

In the
        wake of Typhoon Haiyan, Linkin Park played at Club Nokia during the "Music for Relief: Concert For the Philippines" in Los Angeles, California, and raised donations for victims. The show was broadcast on AXS TV on February 15. Other artists
        during the tour included The Offspring, Bad Religion, Heart, and The Filharmonic.

                        singer has a "neurological condition known as sound-to-color synesthesia", and devised
                        color codes to each song. It's also noted she wanted
                        to explore a "cathartic mode" for the album. She worked on the album with Jack
                        Antonoff in his home studio in New York City.

An indie rock-influenced electronica album, The
                        Love Club EP revolves around Lorde's fear of becoming a new artist. The record received
                        general acclaim from music critics, who praised its overall
                        production and compared its musical style to works by Sky Ferreira, Florence &amp; the Machine
                        and Lana Del Rey. The release peaked at number two in New Zealand and Australia. In the US, the
                        record charted at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart and
                        has sold 60,000 copies. To promote The Love Club EP, Lorde performed during various concerts and
                        released "Royals" as the only single from the EP. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/The+Love+Club+EP"&gt;Read

				<content>Ella Marija Lani Yelich-O'Connor (born 7 November 1996), known by her stage name "Lorde" (pronounced (/ˈlɔrd/) (IPA) or "lord" in standard English), is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and multiple Grammy Awards
        winner. She released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013 and her first single, "Royals", in June 2013. Her début album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013.

She was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father,
        an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland.

At the age of 12, she was spotted by A&amp;R scout Scott
        Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O'Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in
        2012.

Officially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit "Royals". On May 27 2013, "Royals" was covered on national television on the New
        Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. "Royals" débuted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In
        the U.S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts
        as a lead singer.

On 8 May 2013, The Love Club EP débuted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996.
        Following the release of "Royals" in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, "I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right". In
        November 2013, her song "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" was included on the soundtrack of "the movie "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and
        Men, and Imagine Dragons among others.

The "Tennis Court" single was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The "Tennis Court EP" was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically
        on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles final. On 14 June 2013, Yelich-O'Connor's second single "Tennis Court" débuted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top
        40 singles chart. In the same week, she also became the first New Zealand artist to simultaneously have four songs in the top 20 tracks of the New Zealand Top 40. Previously, Titanium held this record with three songs.

				<content>Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band that originated in Los Angeles, California, United States. The group was formed in 1994 as Kara's Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead
        vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara's Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, "The Fourth World", in 1997. After a tepid response to the
        album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New
        York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote.

In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under
        the name: Maroon 5. At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and
        released their debut album, "Songs About Jane", in June 2002. The album's lead single "Harder to Breathe", received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the
        Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005. For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004's "1.22.03.Acoustic" and 2005's "Live Friday the
        13th". In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, "It Won't Be Soon Before Long" and released it in
        May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, "Makes Me Wonder", became the band's first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100.

On September 21, 2010, the band released their
        third studio album entitled "Hands All Over". It was re-released in 2011 to include the single "Moves like Jagger" (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, "Moves like
        Jagger" reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, "Overexposed", on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second
        single from Overexposed, "One More Night" (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, "V", with the very-first
        line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums
        in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Maroon+5"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA

					<summary>Abbey Road is the 11th studio album released by the English rock band The Beatles. It is
                        their last recorded album, although Let It Be was the last album released before the band's
                        dissolution in 1970. Work on Abbey Road began in April
                        1969, and the album was released on 26 September 1969 in the United Kingdom, and 1 October 1969
                        in the United States.

Abbey Road is widely regarded as one of The Beatles' most
                        tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely
                        operating as a functioning unit at the time. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road"&gt;Read

					<content>Abbey Road is the 11th studio album released by the English rock band The Beatles. It is

                        operating as a functioning unit at the time. Despite the tensions within the band, Abbey Road
                        was released to near universal acclaim and is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all
                        time. In 2012, Abbey Road was voted 14th on Rolling Stone
                        magazine's list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2009, readers of the
                        magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road"&gt;Read

                        material was prepared for release with producer Phil Spector. He most prominently added the
                        orchestral arrangement on The Long and Winding Road. Furthermore the legendary
                        rooftop-recordings of Dig A Pony and Get Back, and the last ever Beatles studio
                        recording –I Me Mine– were added to complete the set of tracks that would be released as The
                        Last Beatles Album: Let It Be ...
In 2003 a not-produced-by-Phil-Spector reissue of Let It
                        Be was published as Let It Be... Naked under supervision of
                        Paul McCartney featuring various alternate takes, and a more modest sound production. &lt;a

                        Apple and EMI as the preferred version of the record when
                        The Beatles' discography was being updated for the Compact Disc format; This was the only
                        US release chosen to be included with the other UK releases (other US records were subsequently
                        released as part of The Capitol Albums volumes 1 and 2
                        boxed sets, but not individually). The inclusion of the 1967 singles on CD with this album meant
                        both that the Magical Mystery Tour CD would be of comparable length to the band's other
                        album CDs, and that those three singles would not need to be
                        included on Past Masters, a two-volume compilation designed to accompany the initial CD album
                        releases and provide all non-album tracks (mostly singles) on CD format. &lt;a

					<content>Revolver is the seventh studio album by English rock band the Beatles, released on 5 August
                        1966 on the Parlophone label and produced by George Martin. Many of the tracks on Revolver
                        feature an electric guitar-rock sound that contrasts with

                        group's recording career".

It reached number one on both the British chart
                        and American chart and stayed at the top spot for seven weeks and six weeks, respectively. The
                        album was remastered 9 September 2009 for the first time
                        since its 1987 digital compact disc release. Placed at number 1 in the All-Time Top 1000 Albums
                        and number 3 in the Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time,
                        the album is often regarded as one of the greatest
                        achievements in music history and one of the Beatles' greatest studio achievements. &lt;a

History

Musically,
                        the Beatles broadened their sound, most notably with influences drawn from the contemporary
                        folk-rock of the Byrds and Bob Dylan. The album also saw the
                        Beatles broadening rock n' roll's instrumental resources, most notably on Norwegian
                        Wood (This Bird Has Flown). Although both the Yardbirds and the Kinks had used Indian influences
                        in their music, this track is generally credited as being
                        the first pop recording to use an actual sitar, an Indian stringed instrument, and Norwegian
                        Wood sparked a musical craze for the sound of the novel instrument in the mid-Sixties. George
                        Harrison soon became fanatically interested in the genre and
                        began taking sitar lessons from renowned Indian sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar. A broadening use of
                        percussive arrangements, led by Ringo Starr's backbeats and frequently augmented by maracas
                        and tambourine, can also be heard throughout the album,
                        showcased in tracks such as Wait and Think For Yourself.

Recording innovations were
                        also made during the recording of the album—for instance, the keyboard solo in In My Life sounds
                        like a harpsichord, but was actually played on a piano.
                        George Martin found he could not match the tempo of the song while playing in this baroque
                        style, so he tried recording with the tape running at half-speed. When played back at normal
                        speed during the mixdown, the sped-up sound gave the illusion of a
                        harpsichord. Other production innovations included the use of electronic sound processing on
                        many instruments, notably the heavily compressed and equalised piano sound on John Lennon's
                        The Word; this distinctive effect soon became extremely
                        popular in the genre of psychedelic music.

Lyrically, the album was a major
                        progression. Though a smattering of earlier Beatles songs had expressed romantic doubt and
                        negativity, the songs on Rubber Soul represented a pronounced development
                        in sophistication, thoughtfulness, and ambiguity. In particular, the relationships between the
                        sexes moved from simpler boy-girl love songs to more nuanced, even negative portrayals.
                        Norwegian Wood, one of the most famous examples and often cited as
                        the Beatles' first conscious assimilation of the lyrical innovations of Bob Dylan, sketches
                        a poetically ambiguous extramarital affair between the singer and a mysterious girl. Drive My
                        Car serves as a satirical piece of reverse sexism. Songs
                        like I'm Looking Through You, You Won't See Me, and Girl express more emotionally
                        complex, even bitter and downbeat portrayals of romance, and Nowhere Man was arguably the first
                        Beatles song to move beyond a romantic subject (arguable
                        because the song Help!, released earlier in 1965, also appears not to be specifically about a
                        boy-girl relationship—the song takes the form of a general cry for "help" from the
                        singer to another person, whose relationship to the singer
                        remains unspecified. Even the line "Now I find I need you like I've never done before",
                        could be addressed to any close friend of the singer, not necessarily a romantic partner).

After
                        completing the album and the accompanying
                        single We Can Work It Out and Day Tripper, the Beatles were exhausted from years of virtually
                        non-stop recording, touring, and film work. They subsequently took a three-month break during
                        the first part of 1966, and used this free time exploring new
                        directions that would colour their subsequent musical work. These became immediately apparent in
                        the next album, Revolver.

Until very late in their career, the "primary"
                        version of the Beatles' albums was always the monophonic
                        mix. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, the group, producer George Martin, and the
                        Abbey Road engineers devoted most of their time and attention to the mono mixdowns, and the band
                        were usually all present throughout these sessions and
                        actively participated in them. Even with their landmark Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club
                        Band LP, the stereo mixdowns were considered less important than the mono version and were
                        completed in far less time than the mono mixdown.

While
                        the stereo version of the original release of Rubber Soul was similar to that of their earliest
                        albums, featuring mainly vocals on the right channel and instruments on the left, it was not
                        produced in the same manner. The early albums were recorded
                        on twin-track tape, and they were intended only for production of monaural records, so they kept
                        vocals and instruments separated allowing the two parts to later be mixed in proper proportion.
                        By this time, however, the Beatles were recording on
                        four-track tape, which allowed a stereo master to be produced with vocals in the centre and
                        instruments on both sides, as evidenced in their prior albums Beatles for Sale and Help!. But
                        Martin was looking for a way to easily produce a stereo album
                        which sounded good on a monaural record player. In what he admits was some experimentation, he
                        mixed down the four-track master tape to stereo with vocals on the right, instruments on the
                        left, and nothing in the middle.

The song Wait was
                        initially recorded for, and then left off, the album Help!. The reason the song was released on
                        Rubber Soul was that album that was one song short, and with the Christmas deadline looming, the
                        Beatles chose to release Wait instead of recording a new
                        composition.

Paul McCartney claims to have conceived the album's title after
                        overhearing a black musician's description of Mick Jagger's singing style as "plastic
                        soul". John Lennon confirmed this in a 1970 interview
                        with Rolling Stone, stating, "That was Paul's title... meaning English soul. Just a
                        pun." Also, Paul says the words "Plastic soul, man. Plastic soul..." at the end
                        of I'm Down take 1, on Anthology 2.


Album
                        artwork
 
The photo of the Beatles on the Rubber Soul cover appears stretched. McCartney
                        relates the story behind this in Volume 5 of the documentary film Anthology. Photographer Bob
                        Freeman had taken some pictures of the Beatles at
                        Lennon's house. Freeman showed the photos to the Beatles by projecting them onto an
                        album-sized piece of cardboard to simulate how they would appear on an album cover. The unusual
                        Rubber Soul album cover came to be when the slide card fell
                        slightly backwards, elongating the projected image of the photograph and stretching it. Excited
                        by the effect, they shouted, "Ah! Can we have that? Can you do it like that?" Freeman
                        said he could.

Capitol Records used a different
                        colour saturation for the US version, causing the orange lettering used by Parlophone Records to
                        show up as different colours. On some Capitol LP's, the title looks rich chocolate brown;
                        others, more like gold. Yet on the official 1987 CD of the
                        British version, the Capitol logo is visible, and the letters are not brown, nor the official
                        orange, but a distinct green. The lettering was designed by Charles Front.


Release
                        details

There were two different stereo versions
                        released on vinyl in the US: the standard US stereo mix, and the "Dexter Stereo"
                        version (a.k.a. the "East Coast" version), which has a layer of reverb added to the
                        entire album. The standard US stereo mix and the original mono
                        mix are available on CD as part of The Capitol Albums, Volume 2 box set.


US
                        release

Rubber Soul came out in the United States three days after the British release,
                        and began its 59-week long chart run on Christmas Day. It
                        topped the charts for six weeks from 8 January 1966, before dropping back. The album sold 1.2
                        million copies within nine days of its release, and to date has sold over four million copies in
                        America.

Like other pre-Sgt. Pepper Beatles
                        albums, Rubber Soul differed markedly in its US and UK configurations; indeed, through
                        peculiarities of sequencing, the US Rubber Soul was deliberately reconfigured to appear a folk
                        rock album to angle the Beatles into that nascent and lucrative
                        American idiom during 1965, thanks to the addition of I've Just Seen a Face and It's
                        Only Love (leftovers from the UK Help!) and the deletion of some of the more upbeat tracks
                        (Drive My Car, Nowhere Man, If I Needed Someone, and What Goes
                        On). The tracks missing on the US version would later surface on the Yesterday... and Today
                        collection. The track variation resulted in a shorter album length, clocking in at 29:59. In
                        addition, the stereo mix sent to the US from England has what are
                        commonly called "false starts" at the beginning of I'm Looking Through You. The
                        track is also slightly shorter at the end. The false starts are on every American copy of the
                        album from 1965 to 1990 and are also on the CD boxed set, The
                        Capitol Albums Vol. 2. The US version of The Word is also recognizably different.


CD
                        release

The album was released on CD in the UK and US in April 1987, using the 14-song
                        UK track lineup. Having been available only as an
                        import in the US in the past, the 14 track UK version of the album was issued on LP and cassette
                        on July 21, 1987. As with the CD release of the 1965 Help! album, the Rubber Soul CD featured a
                        contemporary stereo digital remix of the album prepared
                        by George Martin. This remix is somewhat controversial among Beatle fans — many purists prefer
                        the 1965 mix. Strangely, a few Canadian-origin CD editions of Rubber Soul and Help! accidentally
                        use the original mix of the album, presumably due to a
                        mix-up.


Reception

The album was commercially successful, beginning a
                        42-week run in the British charts on 11 December 1965. On Christmas Day replaced Help!—The
                        Beatles' previous album—at the top of the charts, a position
                        Rubber Soul held for eight weeks. The album was a major artistic leap for the group, and is
                        often cited by critics, as well as members of the band, as the point at which the Beatles'
                        earlier Merseybeat sound began to be transformed into the
                        eclectic, sophisticated pop/rock of their later career. John Lennon later said this was the
                        first album on which the Beatles were in complete creative control during recording, with enough
                        studio time to develop and refine new sound ideas. The US
                        version of the album also greatly influenced The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, who "answered"
                        the album by releasing Pet Sounds in 1966. The album became a classic—on 9 May 1987, it returned
                        to the album charts for three weeks, and ten
                        years later made another comeback to the charts.

Rubber Soul is often cited as one of
                        the greatest albums in pop music history. In 1998, Q magazine readers voted it the 40th greatest
                        album of all time, while in 2000 the same magazine placed
                        it at number 21 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2001, VH1 placed it at
                        number 6. In 2003, the album was ranked number 5 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the
                        500 greatest albums of all time. In 2006, the album was
                        chosen by Time magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Rubber+Soul"&gt;Read

					<content>The Beatles is the ninth official British album and the fifteenth American album by The
                        Beatles, a double album released in 1968. It is commonly known as The White Album as it has no
                        graphics or text other than the band’s name (and, on the
                        early LP and CD releases, a serial number) on its plain white sleeve. The album was the first
                        the Beatles undertook following the death of their manager, Brian Epstein, and the first
                        released by their own record label, Apple. Originally entitled A
                        Doll’s House, the title was changed when the British progressive rock band Family released the
                        similarly titled Music in a Doll’s House earlier that year.

The Beatles was written and
                        recorded during a period of turmoil for the group. After
                        visiting the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India and having a particularly productive songwriting
                        session in early 1968, the group returned to the studio for recording from May to October 1968,
                        only to have conflict and dissent drive the group members
                        apart. Drummer Ringo Starr quit the band for a brief time, leaving bassist Paul McCartney to
                        perform drums on some of the album’s songs.

Upon release in November 1968, the album
                        received mixed to positive reviews and reached the number one
                        spot on the charts in the United Kingdom and United States. The album is notable for the
                        eclectic nature of its songs, which has divided critics in evaluating the album’s legacy. Still,
                        The Beatles is regarded as one of the greatest albums in rock
                        history. In 2003, the album was ranked number 10 on Rolling Stone magazine’s list of “The 500
                        Greatest Albums of All Time”.

Most of the songs were conceived during a transcendental
                        meditation course with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh,
                        India in the spring of 1968. Although the retreat, which had required long periods of
                        meditation, was initially conceived by the band as a spiritual respite from all worldly
                        endeavours—a chance, in John Lennon’s words, to “get away from everything”—
                        both Lennon and Paul McCartney had quickly found themselves in songwriting mode, often meeting
                        “clandestinely in the afternoons in each other’s rooms” to review the new work. “Regardless of
                        what I was supposed to be doing,” Lennon would later recall,
                        “I did write some of my best songs there.” Close to forty new compositions had emerged in
                        Rishikesh, twenty-three of which would be laid down in very rough form at Kinfauns, George
                        Harrison’s home in Esher, in May of 1968.

The Beatles had
                        left Rishikesh before the end of the course, with Ringo Starr and then McCartney departing
                        first, and Lennon and Harrison departing together later. According to some reports, Lennon left
                        Rishikesh because he felt personally betrayed by rumours that
                        Maharishi had made sexual advances toward Mia Farrow, who had accompanied The Beatles on their
                        trip. Shortly after he decided to leave, Lennon wrote a song called “Maharishi” which included
                        the lyrics, “Maharishi/You little twat”; the song became
                        “Sexy Sadie”. According to several authors, Alexis Mardas (aka “Magic Alex”) deliberately
                        engineered these rumours because he was bent on undermining the Maharishi’s influence over each
                        Beatle. In a 1980 interview, Lennon acknowledged that the
                        Maharishi was the inspiration for the song: “I just called him ‘Sexy Sadie’.

The
                        Beatles was recorded between 30 May 1968 and 14 October 1968, largely at Abbey Road Studios,
                        with some sessions at Trident Studios. Although productive, the
                        sessions were reportedly undisciplined and sometimes fractious, and they took place at a time
                        when tensions were growing within the group. Concurrent with the recording of this album, The
                        Beatles were launching their new multimedia business
                        corporation Apple Corps, an enterprise that proved to be a source of significant stress for the
                        band.

The sessions for The Beatles marked the first appearance in the studio of
                        Lennon’s new girlfriend and artistic partner, Yoko Ono, who would
                        thereafter be a more or less constant presence at all Beatles sessions. Prior to Ono’s
                        appearance on the scene, the individual Beatles had been very insular during recording sessions,
                        with influence from outsiders strictly limited. McCartney’s
                        girlfriend at the time, Francie Schwartz, was also present at some of the recording sessions.

Author
                        Mark Lewisohn reports that The Beatles held their first and only 24-hour recording/producing
                        session near the end of the creation of The
                        Beatles, which occurred during the final mixing and sequencing for the album. The session was
                        attended by Lennon, McCartney, and producer George Martin.

Despite the album’s official
                        title, which emphasised group identity, studio efforts on
                        The Beatles captured the work of four increasingly individualised artists who frequently found
                        themselves at odds. The band’s work pattern changed dramatically with this project, and by most
                        accounts the extraordinary synergy of The Beatles’ previous
                        studio sessions was harder to come by during this period. Sometimes McCartney would record in
                        one studio for prolonged periods of time, while Lennon would record in another, each man using
                        different engineers. At one point in the sessions, George
                        Martin, whose authority over the band in the studio had waned, spontaneously left to go on
                        holiday, leaving Chris Thomas in charge of producing. During one of these sessions, while
                        recording “Helter Skelter”, Harrison reportedly ran around the studio
                        while holding a flaming ashtray above his head.

Long after the recording of The Beatles
                        was complete, Martin mentioned in interviews that his working relationship with The Beatles
                        changed during this period, and that many of the band’s
                        efforts seemed unfocused, often yielding prolonged jam sessions that sounded uninspired. On 16
                        July recording engineer Geoff Emerick, who had worked with the group since Revolver, announced
                        he was no longer willing to work with the
                        group.

The sudden departures were not limited to EMI personnel. On 22 August, Starr
                        abruptly left the studio, explaining later that he felt his role was minimised compared to that
                        of the other members, and that he was tired of waiting
                        through the long and contentious recording sessions. Lennon, McCartney and Harrison pleaded with
                        Starr to return, and after two weeks he did. Upon Starr’s return, he found his drum kit
                        decorated with red, white and blue flowers, a welcome-back
                        gesture from Harrison. The reconciliation was, however, only temporary, and Starr’s exit served
                        as a precursor of future “months and years of misery”, in Starr’s words. Indeed, after The
                        Beatles was completed, both Harrison and Lennon would stage
                        similar unpublicised departures from the band. McCartney, whose public departure in 1970 would
                        mark the formal end of the band’s ensemble, described the sessions for The Beatles as a turning
                        point for the group. Up to this point, he observed, “The
                        world was a problem, but we weren’t. You know, that was the best thing about The Beatles, until
                        we started to break up, like during the White Album and stuff. Even the studio got a bit tense
                        then.”

According to Lewisohn, McCartney played
                        drums on “Back in the U.S.S.R.” because Starr had left the group during the period when the song
                        was being recorded. Lewisohn also reports that, in the case of “Dear Prudence”, also recorded
                        during Starr’s absence, the three remaining Beatles each
                        made contributions on bass and drums, with the result that those parts may be composite tracks
                        played by Lennon, McCartney and/or Harrison. As of 2010, the actual musician/instrument lineup
                        on the track remains disputed.

Though not formally
                        credited on the album, Eric Clapton played lead guitar on Harrison’s “While My Guitar Gently
                        Weeps”. Harrison explains in The Beatles Anthology that Clapton’s presence temporarily
                        alleviated the studio tension and that all band members were on their
                        best behaviour during his time with the band in the studio. Harrison, who had invited Clapton to
                        the sessions, soon reciprocated by collaborating with Clapton on the song “Badge” for Cream’s
                        last album Goodbye.

Clapton was not the only
                        outside musician to sit in on the sessions. Nicky Hopkins provided electric piano for the single
                        cut of “Revolution” (recorded during these sessions); Hopkins also provided acoustic piano on a
                        number of tracks. Several horns were also recorded on the
                        album version of “Revolution 1”. “Savoy Truffle” also features the horn section. Jack Fallon
                        played a bluegrass fiddle on “Don’t Pass Me By”, and a team of orchestral players and background
                        singers appeared on “Good Night” (which was Beatle-free
                        except for Ringo’s vocal).

The sessions for The Beatles were notable for the band’s
                        formal transition from 4-track to 8-track recording. As work on the album began, Abbey Road
                        Studios possessed, but had yet to install, an 8-track machine
                        that had supposedly been sitting in a storage room for months. This was in accordance with EMI’s
                        policy of testing and customizing new gear, sometimes for months, before putting it into use in
                        the studios. The Beatles recorded “Hey Jude” and “Dear
                        Prudence” at Trident Studios in central London, which had an 8-track recorder. When they learned
                        about EMI’s 8-track recorder, they insisted on using it, and engineers Ken Scott and Dave
                        Harries took the machine (without authorization from the studio
                        chiefs) into the Number 2 recording studio at Abbey Road for the band’s use.

Songs

Although
                        most of the songs on any given Beatles album are usually credited to the Lennon/McCartney
                        songwriting team, that description is often
                        misleading, and rarely more so than on The Beatles. With this album, each of the four band
                        members began to showcase the range and depth of his individual songwriting talents, and to
                        display styles that would be carried over to his eventual solo
                        career. Indeed, some songs that the individual Beatles were working on during this period
                        eventually were released on solo albums. These include Lennon’s “Look at Me” and “Child of
                        Nature”, eventually reworked as “Jealous Guy”; McCartney’s “Junk” and
                        “Teddy Boy”; and Harrison’s “Not Guilty” and “Circles”.

Many of the songs on the album
                        display experimentation with unlikely musical genres, borrowing directly from such sources as
                        1930s dance-hall music (in “Honey Pie”), classical chamber
                        music (in “Piggies”), the avant-garde sensibilities of Yoko Ono and John Cage (in “Revolution
                        9”), and the lush sentimentality of Henry Mancini’s film scores (in “Good Night”). Such
                        diversity was quite unprecedented in global pop music in 1968, and
                        the album’s sprawling approach provoked (and continues to provoke) both praise and criticism
                        from observers. “Revolution 9”, in particular, a densely layered
                        eight-minute-and-thirteen-second sound collage, has attracted both interest and disapproval
                        from both fans and music critics over the years.

The only western instrument available
                        to the group during their Indian visit was the acoustic guitar, and thus most of the songs on
                        The Beatles were written and first performed on that
                        instrument. Some of these songs remained acoustic on The Beatles (notably “Rocky Raccoon”,
                        “Blackbird”, “Julia”, “Cry Baby Cry”, “I Will” and “Mother Nature’s Son”) and were recorded in
                        the studio either solo, or by only part of the group.

A
                        number of songs were recorded during these sessions but were never included on a Beatles record,
                        including Harrison’s “Not Guilty” (which he rerecorded for his 1979 self-titled album, George
                        Harrison), Lennon’s “What’s the New Mary Jane” (which has
                        been previously recorded), and McCartney’s “Jubilee” (later retitled “Junk” and released on
                        McCartney’s first solo LP).

Others included “Mean Mr. Mustard” and “Polythene Pam”
                        (both of which would be used for the medley on Abbey Road); “Child
                        of Nature” (recorded with drastically different lyrics as “Jealous Guy” for Lennon’s Imagine);
                        “Etcetera” (a McCartney composition later recorded by the Black Dyke Mills Band as
                        “Thingumybob”); “The Long and Winding Road” (completed in 1969 for the
                        Let It Be LP); “Something” (which ended up on Abbey Road); and “Sour Milk Sea” (which Harrison
                        gave to friend and Apple artist Jackie Lomax for his first LP, Is This What You Want).

Other
                        songs recorded for, but ultimately left off The
                        Beatles received significant exposure via bootlegs, notably Harrison’s “Circles” (which he would
                        eventually re-record as solo tracks and release on his 1982 album, Gone Troppo) and “Not
                        Guilty”, and Lennon’s manic “What’s the New Mary Jane”. More
                        recently, the song “Revolution 1 (Take 20)”, a previously unknown track, surfaced in 2009 on the
                        Europe-only bootleg Revolution: Take…Your Knickers Off and is supposed to connect “Revolution 1”
                        and the avant-garde “Revolution 9” (both of which
                        appeared on The Beatles) in an attempt by Lennon to record one long version of “Revolution”
                        before ultimately splitting the two songs up.

The Beatles was the first Beatles’ album
                        released by Apple Records, as well as their only original
                        double album. Producer George Martin has said that he was against the idea of a double album at
                        the time and suggested to the group that they reduce the number of songs in order to form a
                        single album featuring their stronger work, but that the band
                        decided against this. Interviewed for the Beatles Anthology, Starr said he now felt it should
                        have been released as two separate albums (that he appropriately named The White Album and The
                        Whiter Album). Harrison felt on reflection that some of the
                        tracks could have been released as B-sides, but “there was a lot of ego in that band”. He also
                        supported the idea of the double album, to clear out the backlog of songs the group had at the
                        time. McCartney, by contrast, said it was fine as it was and
                        that its wide variety of songs was a major part of the album’s appeal.

The Beatles
                        shares the same release date (22 November) as The Beatles’ second album, With the Beatles,
                        released five years earlier.

Although “Hey Jude” was not
                        intended to be included on any LP release, it was recorded during the White Album sessions and
                        was released as a stand-alone single before the release of The Beatles. “Hey Jude’s” B-side,
                        “Revolution”, was an alternate version of the album’s
                        “Revolution 1”. Lennon had wanted the original version of “Revolution” to be released as a
                        single, but the other three Beatles objected on the grounds that it was too slow. A new, faster
                        version, with heavily distorted guitar and a high-energy
                        keyboard solo from Nicky Hopkins was recorded, and was relegated to the flip side of “Hey Jude”.
                        The resulting release — “Hey Jude” on side A and “Revolution” on side B — emerged as the first
                        release on the Beatles’ new Apple Records label. It went
                        on to be the Beatles’ most successful single, with world sales over 5 million by the end of 1968
                        and 7.5 million by October 1972.

Four tracks from the “White Album” were released on
                        two American and one British single almost eight years
                        after the original album was released. In the summer 1976, to promote the compilation album,
                        Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, EMI’s Parlophone label in the UK and its Capitol label in the US each
                        released a single that contained A and B-sides that appeared on
                        the compilation album. In Britain, Parlophone issued “Back in the U.S.S.R.” as the single. (Its
                        B-side was “Twist and Shout”, which originally appeared on the group’s first album, Please
                        Please Me.) In America, Capitol released “Got to Get You Into
                        My Life” (from the group’s 1966 album, Revolver) on the A-side, but selected “Helter Skelter,”
                        to serve as the flip side. “Helter Skelter” was likely chosen for the B-side because a cover
                        version of the song had been prominently featured in a
                        made-for-TV movie about the Charles Manson murders that had aired on CBS shortly before the
                        release of Rock ‘n’ Roll Music. The singles were successful, with “Got to Get You into My Life”
                        hitting No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US and “Back in
                        the U.S.S.R.” hitting No. 18 on the New Musical Express chart in Britain. Both records also
                        helped sell Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, which hit No. 2 in the United States and No. 10 in the UK. With
                        the success of the singles from the compilation album,
                        Capitol followed-up “Got To Get You Into My Life” with the release of another single in November
                        1976. Instead of taking two more tracks from Rock ‘n’ Roll Music, however, Capitol selected two
                        “White Album” tracks—”Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” as the A-Side,
                        and “Julia” as the B-Side. The “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” single was sold in an individually-numbered
                        white picture sleeve that mimicked the design of the original album. “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da” did
                        not duplicate the success of its predecessor, however, as it
                        failed to make the Top Forty, stalling out at No. 49 on Billboard.

The Beatles was the
                        last Beatles album to be released with a unique, alternate mono mix, albeit one issued only in
                        the UK and a few other countries. Twenty-eight of the
                        album’s 30 tracks (“Revolution 1” and “Revolution 9” being the only exceptions) exist in
                        official alternate mono mixes. Several of these mono mixes are quite different from the stereo
                        versions.

Beatles’ albums after The Beatles (except
                        Yellow Submarine in the UK) occasionally had mono pressings in certain countries (such as
                        Brazil), but these editions—Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be—were in each case mono
                        fold-downs from the regular stereo mixes.

In the US, mono
                        records were already being phased out; the US release of The Beatles was the first Beatles LP to
                        be issued in stereo only.

The mono version of The Beatles was made available worldwide
                        (including the US) on 9 September 2009, as part of the
                        Beatles in Mono CD box set.

The album’s sleeve was designed by Richard Hamilton, a
                        notable pop artist who had organised a Marcel Duchamp retrospective at the Tate Gallery the
                        previous year. Hamilton’s design was in stark contrast to Peter
                        Blake’s vivid cover art for Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, and consisted of a plain
                        white sleeve. The band’s name was discreetly embossed slightly below the middle of the album’s
                        right side, and the cover also featured a unique stamped serial
                        number, “to create,” in Hamilton’s words, “the ironic situation of a numbered edition of
                        something like five million copies.” Indeed, the artist intended the cover to resemble the
                        “look” of conceptual art, an emerging movement in contemporary art at
                        the time. Later vinyl record releases in the US showed the title in grey printed (rather than
                        embossed) letters. Early copies on compact disc were also numbered. Later CD releases rendered
                        the album’s title in black or grey. The 30th anniversary CD
                        release was done to look like the original album sleeve, with an embossed title and serial
                        number, including a small reproduction of the poster and pictures (see re-issues).

The
                        album’s inside packaging included a poster, the lyrics to the
                        songs, and a set of photographs taken by John Kelly during the autumn of 1968 that have
                        themselves become iconic. This is the only sleeve of a Beatles studio album not to show the
                        members of the band on the front.

Tape versions of the album
                        did not feature a white cover. Instead, cassette, reel-to-reel, and 8-track versions (first
                        issued on two cartridges in early 1969) contained cover artwork that featured high contrast
                        black and white (with no grey) versions of the four Kelly
                        photographs. In both the cassette and 8-track versions of the album, the two tapes were sold in
                        a black slip-cover box that bore the title, “The Beatles” and the outline of an apple, embossed
                        in silver. This departure from the LP’s design not only
                        made it difficult for less-informed fans to identify the tape in record stores, but it also led
                        some fans at the time to jokingly refer to the 8-track or cassette not as the “white album” but
                        as the “black tape.” In 1988, Capitol/EMI re-issued the
                        2-cassette version of the album, still with the same cover artwork as the original cassettes,
                        but without the black slip-cover box.

The Beatles were at the peak of their global
                        influence and visibility in late 1968. Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely
                        Hearts Club Band, released the previous year, had enjoyed a combination of commercial success,
                        critical acclaim, and immense cultural influence that had previously seemed inconceivable for a
                        pop release. Time, for instance, had written in 1967 that
                        Pepper constituted a “historic departure in the progress of music—any music,” while Timothy
                        Leary, in a widely quoted assessment of the same period, declared that the band were prototypes
                        of “evolutionary agents sent by God, endowed with mysterious
                        powers to create a new human species.” After releasing an album that had delivered such
                        critical, commercial, and generational shockwaves, The Beatles faced the inevitable question of
                        what they could possibly do to top it. The next full-length album,
                        whatever it was, was destined to draw considerable scrutiny. The intervening release of Magical
                        Mystery Tour notwithstanding (released as a double-EP package in the UK), The Beatles
                        represented the group’s first major musical statement since Sgt.
                        Pepper, and thus was a highly anticipated event for both the mainstream press and the
                        youth-oriented counter-culture movement with which the band had by this time become strongly
                        associated. Expectations, to say the least, were high.

The
                        reviews were mixed to mostly positive.

* Tony Palmer, in The Observer, wrote shortly
                        after the album’s release: “If there is still any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the
                        greatest songwriters since Schubert, then … the album The Beatles
                        … should surely see the last vestiges of cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in
                        a deluge of joyful music making…”
* Richard Goldstein, writing in The New York Times on 8
                        December 1968, described the album as a “major
                        success.”
* Another review in The New York Times, this one by Nik Cohn, considered the album
                        “boring beyond belief” and described “more than half the songs” as “profound mediocrities.”
*
                        Alan Smith, in an NME review entitled “The Brilliant,
                        the Bad, and the Ugly,” derided “Revolution #9” as a “pretentious” example of “idiot immaturity”
                        and, in the following sentence, assigned the benediction “God Bless You, Beatles!” to “most of
                        the rest” of the album.
* The New Rolling Stone Album
                        Guide praises the album but maintains that it has “loads of self-indulgent filler,” identifying
                        “Revolution #9” in particular as “justly maligned,” and suggests that listeners in the CD era,
                        who can program digital players to skip over unwanted
                        tracks, may have an advantage over the album’s original audience.

Some contemporary
                        critics say the album’s inclusion of supposedly extraneous material is a part of its appeal.
                        Stephen Thomas Erlewine’s review for Allmusic contends
                        that:

* “Each song on the sprawling double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as
                        the band touches on anything and everything they can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot
                        record or a singularly gripping musical experience,
                        depending on your view, but what makes the White Album interesting is its mess.”

One
                        important current trend in critical assessments of the album is to draw parallels between the
                        band’s disintegrating ensemble and the chaotic events of the
                        tumultuous year in which The Beatles was created, 1968. Along these lines, Slant Magazine
                        observed that:

* “(The album) reveals the popping seams of a band that had the pressure
                        of an entire fissuring generational/political gap on its back.
                        Maybe it’s because it shows The Beatles at the point where even their music couldn’t hide the
                        underlying tensions between John, Paul, George, and Ringo, or maybe because it was
                        (coincidentally?) released at the tail end of a year anyone could agree
                        was the embittered honeymoon’s end for the Love Generation, the year when, to borrow from a
                        famous Yeats poem, the center decidedly could not hold … for whatever reason, The Beatles is
                        still one of the few albums by the Fab Four that resists
                        reflexive canonization, which, along with society’s continued fragmentation, keeps the album
                        fresh and surprising.”

In 1997, The Beatles was named the 10th greatest album of all
                        time in a ‘Music of the Millennium’ poll conducted by HMV,
                        Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 17,
                        while in 2000 the same magazine placed it at number seven in its list of the 100 Greatest
                        British Albums Ever.

In 2001, the TV network VH1 named it
                        as the 11th greatest album ever.

It was ranked number 10 in Rolling Stone’s list of the
                        500 greatest albums of all time in 2003.

In 2006, the album was chosen by Time Magazine
                        as one of the 100 best albums of all time.

On
                        the 40th anniversary of the album’s release the Vatican newspaper, L’Osservatore Romano,
                        published a lengthy article which declared that “Forty years later, this album remains a type of
                        magical musical anthology: 30 songs you can go through and
                        listen to at will, certain of finding some pearls that even today remain unparalleled.”
                        Forgiving Lennon’s “more popular than Jesus” remark, the paper called the White Album the
                        “creative summit” of the Beatles’ career, comparing it favourably to
                        contemporary music and taking note of the now antiquated equipment used, concluding that “a
                        listening experience like that offered by the Beatles is truly rare.”

Ian MacDonald, in
                        his book Revolution in the Head, argues that The Beatles was
                        the album in which the band’s cryptic messages to its fan base became not merely vague but
                        intentionally and perhaps dangerously open-ended, citing oblique passages in songs like “Glass
                        Onion” (e.g., “the walrus was Paul”) and “Piggies” (“what they
                        need’s a damn good whacking”). These pronouncements, and many others on the album, came to
                        attract extraordinary popular interest at a time when more of the world’s youth were using drugs
                        recreationally and looking for spiritual, political, and
                        strategic advice from The Beatles. Steve Turner, too, in his book A Hard Day’s Write, maintains
                        that, with this album, “The Beatles had perhaps laid themselves open to misinterpretation by
                        mixing up the languages of poetry and nonsense.” Bob Dylan’s
                        songs had been similarly mined for hidden meanings, but the massive countercultural analysis of
                        The Beatles surpassed anything that had gone before.

Even Lennon’s seemingly direct
                        engagement with the tumultuous political issues of 1968 in
                        “Revolution 1” carried a nuanced obliqueness, and ended up sending messages the author may not
                        have intended. In the album’s version of the song, Lennon advises those who “talk about
                        destruction” to “count me out.” As McDonald notes, however, Lennon
                        then follows the sung word “out” with the spoken word “in.” At the time of the album’s release —
                        which followed, chronologically, the up-tempo single version of the song, “Revolution” — that
                        single word “in” was taken by many on the radical left as
                        Lennon’s acknowledgment, after considered thought, that violence in the pursuit of political
                        aims was indeed justified in some cases. At a time of increasing unrest in the streets and
                        campuses of Paris and Berkeley, the album’s lyrics seemed to many
                        to mark a reversal of Lennon’s position on the question, which was hotly debated during this
                        period. However, the recording chronology belies the interpretation that from the single to the
                        album Lennon moved from a definite position to one of
                        ambivalence, since despite the single’s earlier release it was the album version that was
                        recorded first.

Cult leader Charles Manson persuaded members of his “family” that the
                        album was an apocalyptic message predicting a prolonged race war
                        and justifying the murder of wealthy people.

In October 1969, a Detroit radio program
                        began to promote theories based on clues supposedly left on The Beatles and other Beatles albums
                        that Paul McCartney had died and been replaced by a
                        lookalike. The ensuing hunt for clues to a cover up, that The Beatles presumably wanted to
                        suppress (and simultaneously publicise), became one of the classic examples of an urban legend.

As
                        it was their first studio album in almost eighteen
                        months (and coming after the blockbuster success of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band)
                        expectations were high at time of release of The Beatles. The album debuted at number one in the
                        UK on 1 December 1968, (becoming their third album to do so,
                        after Help! and Revolver). It spent seven weeks at the top of the UK charts (including the
                        entire competitive Christmas season), until it was replaced by The Seekers’ Best of the Seekers
                        on 25 January 1969, dropping to number two. However, the album
                        returned to the top spot the next week, spending an eighth and final week at number one. Then,
                        it spent another four weeks on the Top 10, and then dropped the charts quicker than Sgt. Pepper.
                        The White Album was particularly notable for blocking the
                        Beatles follow-up album, Yellow Submarine, which debuted (and peaked at) number three on 8
                        February 1969, the same week The White Album was dominating the second position on the charts.
                        In all, The Beatles spent 24 weeks on the UK charts, far less
                        than the more than 200 weeks for Sgt. Pepper’s).

In the United States, the album was
                        received with huge commercial success. It debuted at number 11, jumped to number two, and
                        reached number one in its third week, spending a total of nine
                        weeks at the top. In all, The Beatles spent 155 weeks on the Billboard 200. According to the
                        Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles is The Beatles’ best-selling album at
                        19-times platinum and the tenth-best-selling album of all time
                        in the United States. (Each sale is counted as 2 sales, because “The Beatles” is a double record
                        set.)

Two re-issues in 1978 (one by Capitol Records, the other by Parlophone) saw the
                        album pressed on white vinyl, completing the look of the
                        “white” album. In 1985, EMI Electrola released a DMM (direct metal mastering) white vinyl
                        pressing of the album in Germany, which was imported to the United States in large numbers.
                        Another popular white vinyl pressing was manufactured in France. The
                        1978 Parlophone white vinyl export pressing and the German DMM pressing are considered by many
                        to be the best-sounding versions of the album. This is due to the use of the famed Neumann lathe
                        on the 1978 export pressing and the use of the DMM process
                        on the 1985 pressing.

On 7 January 1982, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) released the
                        album in a non-embossed unnumbered version of cover with the ORIGINAL MASTER RECORDING banner at
                        the top. Neither the poster nor portraits were included.
                        The labels to the discs are white with primarily black text and the Capitol dome logo at three
                        o’clock. The MFSL discs were made with Super Vinyl, a heavy and hard compound that provides an
                        extraordinary quiet playing surface. Although MFSL leased
                        the album from Capitol and used the company’s sub-master, many fans believe they sound superior
                        to the standard British and American pressings. The discs were stored in “rice paper”
                        static-free, dust-free inner sleeves enclosed in an off-white
                        gatefold reinforced stiff board that fit into the custom fabricated album jacket.

The
                        album was first released on CD on 25 August 1987.

In 1998, a 30th anniversary reissue
                        of the album was released. The packaging of this release is
                        virtually identical to its vinyl counterpart. It has the same pure white gatefold cover,
                        complete with the title The BEATLES in a slightly raised, embossed graphic at a slight angle. It
                        also included the now-classic sequentially numbered serial
                        number on the front of this cover, thus making this one a real limited edition. The interior of
                        this cover features the song titles on the left-hand side, and the four black-and-white photos
                        of the group members on the right. This version of the
                        cover even accurately mimics the original British vinyl pressing from 1968, with the openings
                        for the discs at the top rather than the sides. There are miniatures of the four full-colour
                        glossy portrait photos included, as well as an exact replica of
                        the poster with the photo collage on one side, and the album’s complete song lyrics on the
                        opposite side. The CDs are housed in black sleeves, which were also used for the original
                        British album. This commemorative double CD album is housed in a
                        clear plastic slipcase.

On 9 September 2009, new remasters of all The Beatles studio
                        albums were released. For this new release, the slipcover holding the CD digipak is embossed in
                        much the same style as the original sleeve. Although there
                        is no serial number on the front, there is a serial number printed along the edges of the CD
                        version. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/The+Beatles"&gt;Read more on

				<content>The Beatles were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the
        1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.
 
After
        conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical 'British Invasion' into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle,
        the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness
        saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. 
 
Early on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in
        Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group's 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to
        England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. 

In 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous
        experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment "guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein", his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to
        EMI's Parlaphone label. 

Later, due in part to Martin's refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed
        to play on their first single, "Love Me Do", but George Martin had Andy White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).
 
In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as
        "Beatlemania" in the UK with the song "Please Please Me". Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first
        appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following "I Want to Hold Your Hand" going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day's Night and
        Help!. The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help!, the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one
        scene. 
 
The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion,
        vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the
        Beatles' records, and was a highly influential part of the band's sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on "In My Life" (Rubber Soul). 
 
For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for
        writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary
        lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and The
        Beatles, sometimes known as "The White Album". The White Album is considered the band's most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon's wife), as demonstrated by the song
        "Revolution 9", and the band's increasing use of drugs. The song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" (from Sgt. Pepper's) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted
        that it described a drawing made by John Lennon's son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year
        and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially "quit" the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the
        band's ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts. 
 
The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the
        acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon's 1980 death, for the Anthology project. "Free as a Bird" and "Real Love" were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and
        sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively.
 
The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe
        rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the
        appearance of being a recording of a live performance. 

The Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were "more popular than Jesus
        Christ", causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. 

A widespread urban legend that started in 1969
        claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon's song "How Do You Sleep?".
 
George Harrison passed away
        in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George's death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released Choose Love and Paul released
        Chaos and Creation in the Backyard both in 2005. Paul's latest release is 2007's Memory Almost Full. Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8.

George Harrison once said “The Beatles will exist without us.” Deftly short and simple,
        this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves. 
 
In 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated
        in a show called Love, showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison's widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and
        creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles. 
 
The tracks in "Love" contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin
        created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison's "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". 

In October 2007, Across the Universe, a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was
        released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles' career, sung by the principles. Songs such as "I Want to Hold Your Hand" and "Dear
        Prudence" actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as "Let it Be" and "Across the Universe" seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built. &lt;a

					<content>A Night at the Opera is a 1975 album by English rock band Queen. It was produced by Roy
                        Thomas Baker and Queen, and reportedly was, at the time of its release, the most expensive album
                        ever made. It was originally released by EMI in the UK
                        where it topped the charts for nine weeks, a record at the time, and Elektra Records in the
                        United States where the album peaked at #4 and has been certified Triple Platinum (three million
                        copies sold).
The album takes its name from the Marx
                        Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when
                        recording. The 1976 follow-up album, A Day at the Races, was also named after a Marx brothers
                        film.

At the time the most expensive album ever
                        recorded, Brian May has asserted in subsequent years that the band would have disbanded had it
                        not been successful. Upon release, A Night at the Opera was a commercial and critical success,
                        debuting at #1 in the UK charts and remaining there for nine
                        weeks. In the US, it debuted at #4, the band's strongest showing at that time. Reviews were
                        generally positive. Rolling Stone wrote: "What sets them apart is their selection of
                        unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, acapella vocals, no
                        synthesizers. Coupled with good songs. Queen's obviously the strongest contender in its
                        field." Melody Maker called the album a "must-have," encouraging listeners to
                        "turn it up loud and enjoy," while the Winnipeg Free
                        Press wrote: "The group's potential is practically limitless, indicating that Queen is
                        destined to finally take its place among the small handful of truly major acts working in rock
                        today." Robert Christgau, however, was less
                        enthusiastic, giving the album a "B-" rating. Later reviews in notable publications
                        such as Allmusic, Mojo and Q Magazine, have seen the album receive five-star ratings. Allmusic
                        wrote: "It's prog rock with a sense of humor as
                        well as dynamics, and Queen never bettered their approach anywhere else." Mojo called the
                        album "An imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia; a band of hungrily competitive
                        individualists on a big roll of friendship and delight." Q were
                        similarly receptive, writing: "It's a record to which all four contributed fine songs,
                        and one of extremes -- among the crashing rock and proggy wigouts were love songs, acoustic
                        whimsy, a trad-jazz pastiche and a brace of vaudeville show
                        tunes." Uncut awarded the album only 3/5 stars, but offered a mostly positive review,
                        commending "the extent of the band's barmy diversity."

Since its
                        release, A Night at the Opera has frequently been cited as one of
                        Queen's finest works. In particular, Bohemian Rhapsody, the album's centerpiece,
                        received acclaim and is still considered among the greatest songs ever recorded. The British
                        public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004
                        Channel 4 poll, and the 9th greatest number one album of all time in a 2006 BBC poll. The album
                        has also ranked highly in international polls and has frequently appeared in "greatest
                        albums" lists reflecting the opinions of
                        critics.

A Night at the Opera appears alongside other Queen albums Queen II and Sheer
                        Heart Attack in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

The album was first
                        time re-released in the US on Hollywood Records on 3
                        September 1991 with two bonus remixes, as part of a complete re-release of all Queen albums.

On
                        30 April 2002 the album was again re-released on DVD-Audio with a 5.1-channel mix in Dolby
                        Digital and DTS surround sound.

On 21
                        November 2005 it was once more re-released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album and
                        its first single, "Bohemian Rhapsody". This release is accompanied by a DVD-Video disc
                        with the same track listing featuring the original videos,
                        old and new concert footage (including "'39" from the Queen + Paul Rodgers tour
                        and Brian May on the roof of Buckingham Palace playing "God Save the Queen") and audio
                        commentary by all four bandmembers. It was on this
                        commentary (and on In the Studio with Redbeard, which devoted an episode to A Night at the
                        Opera) that May stated that had the album not been a success, Queen certainly would have
                        disbanded. &lt;a

					<content>Innuendo is a 1991 album by English rock band Queen. It is the band's fourteenth
                        studio album and the last to be composed entirely of new material. It is also the final studio
                        album to be released while lead singer Freddie Mercury was
                        still alive. The album was praised by critics and fans as one of the strongest albums of Queen's
                        later career[citation needed]. It reached number one on the UK album charts (2 weeks) as well as
                        in the Netherlands (4 weeks), in Switzerland (8
                        weeks), Germany (6 weeks), and Italy (3 weeks). The album was released in the United States one
                        day after it was released in Britain. The album would be the first Queen album to go Gold in the
                        US upon its release since The Works in 1984. It peaked at
                        number thirty in the United States.

The album was recorded when Mercury was progressing
                        into the final stages of his HIV/AIDS infection. Much of the material on the album deals with
                        the band's coming to terms with his imminent death.
                        The theme is also reflected in the music, which can be heavy and arresting ("Innuendo"
                        and "Headlong"), but also bleak and dark ("The Show Must Go On","These
                        Are The Days Of Our Lives","I'm Going
                        Slightly Mad" and "Don't Try So Hard"), and very often both ("The
                        Hitman" and "Bijou").

The album cover was designed by Queen and Richard
                        Gray. The booklets and single covers from the album are by
                        Grandville, or are inspired by his illustrations.

 Song information

 Innuendo
Main
                        article: Innuendo (song)
"Innuendo" began as a
                        jam session in Switzerland amongst May, Taylor and Deacon in spring 1989. Mercury was upstairs
                        and heard them playing the beat, and turned it into a song, creating the melody and starting off
                        the lyrics. From then on they all four worked on polishing
                        the track and Taylor took over the lyrics (which were written as a tribute to Led Zeppelin and
                        their song "Kashmir"). The middle section, written by Mercury, was included later and
                        it featured a synth-orchestra programmed by producer David
                        Richards and a flamenco interlude played by Yes guitarist Steve Howe, who had come to visit them
                        and was asked to play what Brian May himself admitted he couldn't. Like "Kashmir",
                        the title of the song is only mentioned
                        once.

"Innuendo" was released as a single in January 1991.

I'm
                        Going Slightly Mad
Main article: I'm Going Slightly Mad
"I'm Going
                        Slightly Mad" was begun in Mercury's London house,
                        after he'd got the idea of writing a song about madness, inspired by Noel Coward's
                        camp one-liners. Most of the lyrics (like "banana tree" or "one needle")
                        came from both him and his friend Peter Straker, who stayed up
                        all night in Mercury's kitchen, devising ever more outlandish lines. The music is Mercury's
                        as well and it's one of the earliest songs they were working on in Montreux when Steve Howe
                        came in. The video that accompanied the song saw
                        Mercury dressed in a costume suit with wild hair, white gloves, long pointing shoes and
                        extremely heavy make up, also filmed in black and white. Whilst Queen fans were thoroughly
                        amused by the band in the video, in the documentary, "Champions of
                        the World," Taylor confessed, from the band's perspective, the video was marred by
                        Mercury's appearance having to be camouflaged by costume and make-up, as Taylor admitted
                        Mercury looked "Pretty ill, at that point." Actress
                        Cleo Rocos stated that Mercury had explained to her and mutual friend Kenny Everett that the
                        song touches on the AIDS induced dementia he incurred during the final years of his life.[1]


Headlong
Main
                        article: Headlong
                        (song)
"Headlong" came from May at the studio they'd got in Switzerland. He
                        recorded it for the solo album he was doing at the same time. Once, May heard Mercury singing
                        it, and instantly decided that it worked better as a Queen
                        track. Then the band took it over and they all made modifications.


I Can't
                        Live with You
"I Can't Live with You" was also written for May's solo
                        album. He gave it to the band as well since Taylor, Deacon and
                        Mercury were fond of the track. Drums were programmed on synth by May, and the keyboard-pads
                        were added by the producer. An alternative version of this song appeared on the 1997 compilation
                        album Queen Rocks, billed as the "'97 Rocks
                        Retake". it was said to be more along the lines of how May and Taylor originally wanted the
                        track to sound, with a harder, guitar-driven rock edge.


 Don't Try So Hard
"Don't
                        Try So Hard" came from
                        Mercury.[2] The intro "rain" is actually the pre-set sound of the Korg M1, which
                        appears when it's switched on. Mercury sings most of the song in falsetto. The song's
                        middle section is written in a style reminiscent of
                        Queen's early 1980s-songs such as Play The Game.


Ride the Wild Wind
"Ride
                        The Wild Wind" was composed by Taylor, who recorded a demo with his own vocals. The
                        definitive version is sung by Mercury with Taylor on
                        backing vocals. The song is a sort of sequel of Roger's "A Night at the Opera"
                        composition, "I'm In Love With My Car", focused on Taylor's passion for cars
                        and race. This time, the song involved all of the other
                        members, that gave life to a fast song with beating drums and rhythmic bass line, which create
                        the sensation of speed and engine's roar. In the mid-part, a brilliant May's solo,
                        which accentuate the sense of high velocity, and also give the
                        song a heavier sound. In some parts a racing car can be heard.

"All God's People" started off as part of Mercury's Barcelona
                        project under the title "Africa by Night" (hence the
                        co-writing credit with Mike Moran). He'd asked May to play guitar, then one thing led to
                        another and the entire band played. Piano was recorded by Mike Moran. The song features Mercury
                        singing a head-voiced high-F note, as well as some very low
                        ones.


These Are the Days of Our Lives
Main article: These Are the Days of Our
                        Lives
"These Are the Days of Our Lives" was written by Roger Taylor. It's
                        harmonically and structurally one of the simplest songs of
                        the band's catalogue. Keyboards were programmed by the four of them in the studio, and
                        conga percussion was recorded by David Richards. The music video for this song was Mercury's
                        last appearance in a video medium. By the time the video was
                        made, it had become impossible to disguise that Freddie was seriously ill. Despite his frail
                        appearance, he appeared and gave what energy he had left, filmed in black and white. The black
                        and white in the video helped somewhat to reduce the ill/frail
                        appearance. When footage of the band making the video was released in colour, it is clear to see
                        why.


Delilah
"Delilah" is a song Mercury penned for his favourite
                        housecat, a female tortoiseshell cat, named Delilah. May
                        recorded his solo using a talk box.


The Hitman
"The Hitman" was
                        written by Mercury as well. The original version was apparently on keyboards and in a different
                        key. May took Mercury's riff (not un-common), changed the
                        key and recorded a demo of the heavy version. Deacon then re-arranged the structure and they all
                        filled the gaps in lyrics and recorded it. All of the backing vocals were done by May.



                        Bijou
"Bijou" was an idea Mercury and
                        May had of making a song "inside-out" (having guitar doing the verses and the vocal
                        doing the break). Mercury put the chords, title and lyrics, and the two of them worked on the
                        guitar parts. Mercury sang the first line and then May
                        transferred the melody to his Red Special. The song was finished without any input from Taylor
                        or Deacon. The idea was not new and already used by Yes on their song "Soon". Brian
                        later credited Jeff Beck's 1989 song "Where Were
                        You" as the inspiration 'Bijou'. In 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers performed this
                        song in their shows of the Rock the Cosmos Tour.

The Show Must Go On
Main article:
                        The Show Must Go On (Queen song)
"The Show Must Go
                        On" was written by May &amp; Mercury. The song was a lively dramatic cross between Opera
                        and Rock. The initial idea was a chord sequence Taylor and Deacon were working on. Then May
                        decided to use the sequence, and both he and Mercury decided the
                        theme of the lyrics and wrote the first verse together. From then on May finished the lyrics,
                        did the vocal melody and wrote the bridge, inspired by Pachelbel's Canon. Some keys and
                        ideas were suggested by the producer too.

The song was
                        initially not released as a single as part of promotion for the innuendo album, but was released
                        in October 1991 as the band launched their 2nd Greatest Hits album. The video for the song
                        featured a compilation of clips from all their videos since
                        1982, in support of the Greatest Hits 2 album. Due to Mercury's now critically fast fading
                        health, a fresh appearance by the band in a video was not possible.

A live version
                        featuring Elton John on vocals appeared on the Greatest Hits
                        III album. Elton stated at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert that the song was a personal
                        favourite of his.

Singles
Five
                        singles were released from the album:

"Innuendo" was the lead single from the
                        album in most countries save the
                        United States where "Headlong" was released as the first single. It was released on 14
                        January 1991 in Europe and March 1991 in the United States as a promo single, becoming Queen's
                        twelfth number-one single. The song also achieved
                        modest success in the US, charting at seventeen on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks
                        chart. Still, the length and style of the track limited its appeal, and it only spent a week at
                        number one in the UK and quickly slid down the chart, spending
                        only six weeks in the top seventy-five. (B-side on 7 inch release- "Bijou") 
"I'm
                        Going Slightly Mad" was released on 4 March 1991. It reached number twenty-two in the UK
                        charts. (B-side on 7 inch release- "The
                        Hitman" in some countries, in others it was "Lost Opportunity" which was a non
                        album cut.) 
"Headlong" was released in January 1991 in the US and on 13 May 1991
                        in the UK. It was one of the most successful songs from the
                        album[citation needed], and actually served as the lead single in the United States. It entered
                        the UK charts at number fourteen, and reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock
                        Tracks chart. (B-side on 7 inch release- "All
                        God's People" in some countries, in others, "Lost Opportunity" and in a few,
                        "The Hitman") 
"The Show Must Go On" was released on 14 October 1991 in
                        the UK. The single was taken from the album, although it
                        had not been released as a single from Innuendo, and released as promotion for the Greatest Hits
                        II album, and peaked at number sixteen in the UK charts. After Mercury's death in November,
                        the song re-entered the British charts and spent longer
                        in the top seventy-five than it had on its original release. This single was released just six
                        weeks before Mercury died. In 1992, the song was released as a double A-side with "Bohemian
                        Rhapsody" in the US and reached #2 in the US. (The
                        original B-side in October 1991 was "Keep Yourself Alive".) 
"These Are the
                        Days of Our Lives" was first released in the USA on Freddie Mercury's birthday, 5
                        September 1991. In the UK it was released in December 1991
                        following Mercury's death, as a double A-side with "Bohemian Rhapsody". The
                        single was the UK's Christmas number one of 1991. 

Promo single
"I Can't
                        Live With You" was released as a promo single to
                        radio stations in the USA. This 2-track promo single, completely remixed by Brian Malouf, uses
                        slightly different lead vocal tracks by Freddie, louder and tighter harmony tracks, and
                        re-programed synth drums, resulting in a much more punchy and
                        "over the top" poppy version than included on the album. It reached #28 on the US
                        Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.

					<summary>
Jazz is a 1978 album by English rock band Queen. It was the band's seventh studio
                        album, and comprises a number of different styles of music, including disco-funk ("Fun It"),
                        vaudeville ("Dreamer's Ball"),
                        hard rock ("Dead On Time") and a country-flavoured stomp ("Fat Bottomed Girls").
                        Curiously, it contains nothing recognisable as jazz, except perhaps the music-hall swing of
                        "Dreamer's Ball". The album's
                        eclecticism was alternately praised and criticised; &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Jazz"&gt;Read

                        album, and comprises a number of different styles of music, including disco-funk ("Fun It"),
                        vaudeville ("Dreamer's Ball"),
                        hard rock ("Dead On Time") and a country-flavoured stomp ("Fat Bottomed Girls").
                        Curiously, it contains nothing recognisable as jazz, except perhaps the music-hall swing of
                        "Dreamer's Ball". The album's
                        eclecticism was alternately praised and criticised; it was subject to a viciously scathing
                        Rolling Stone review by Dave Marsh which included the suggestion that "Queen may be the
                        first truly fascist rock band." Nevertheless, the album made
                        it to #6 on the American Billboard 200.

The band had intended to sell the album with a
                        poster depicting the all-female nude bicycle race staged to promote "Fat Bottomed Girls",
                        but in the USA it was only available through mail
                        order so as not to upset retailers. A small version of the poster comes with the Crown Jewels
                        box set.

Roy Thomas Baker temporarily reunited with Queen and became their producer for
                        this album. It was 3 years since he co-produced
                        Queen's 1975 album A Night at the Opera. But this album also was the last album he
                        co-produced for the band.

This was the first Queen album recorded outside the UK, for
                        tax purposes.

Included in the liner notes is the
                        attribution "Thunderbolt courtesy of God", referring to the crash of thunder heard at
                        the end of the song "Dead On Time" which May recorded with a portable audio recorder
                        during a thunderstorm.

The album artwork was
                        suggested by Roger Taylor, who previously saw a similar design painted on the Berlin Wall.

 Song information

Mustapha
Main
                        article: Mustapha
"Mustapha" ( Sample (help·info)) is a song written by Freddie
                        Mercury. It was released as a single in 1979.

The
                        lyrics consist mostly of Persian, which is not understandable for those who are not familiar
                        with the language. The only understandable words are "Mustapha", "Ibrahim"
                        and the phrases "Allah, Allah, Allah will pray for
                        you", "salaam aleikum" and "aleikum salaam". The rest is improvised
                        words like "ichna klibhra him" and "rabbla fihmtrashim".

In live
                        performances, Mercury would often sing the opening vocals of
                        "Mustapha" in place of the complex introduction to "Bohemian Rhapsody",
                        going from "Allah will pray for you" to "Mama, just killed a man...".
                        However, sometimes the band performed an almost full version of the
                        song, with Mercury at the piano.


 Fat Bottomed Girls
"Fat Bottomed Girls"
                        was written by May with lead vocals shared by May and Mercury in the album version. On stage
                        Mercury sang the entire song, with Taylor and May doing
                        harmonies.


 Jealousy
"Jealousy" was penned by Mercury and features
                        May playing his Hairfred acoustic guitar placing small pieces of piano wire under the frets to
                        produce the "buzzing" effect of a sitar. All
                        vocals were recorded by Mercury. It was released as a single in 1979.

Bicycle Race
"Bicycle
                        Race" (Sample (info)) is a complex composition by Mercury. It features several modulations,
                        unusual chord functions, a metre change
                        (4/4 to 3/4 and back) and a programmatic section (a race of guitars emulating the bicycle race).



                        If You Can't Beat Them
"If You Can't Beat Them" was another Hard Rock
                        composition by John Deacon and was a live
                        favourite for the band in late '70s. It is one of the few songs by Deacon where May plays
                        all the guitars and contains a guitar solo of over two minutes, making it one of the longest
                        guitar solos in a Queen song.


 Let Me Entertain
                        You
"Let Me Entertain You" was written by Mercury, directed towards the audience.
                        The line "we'll sing to you in Japanese" is a reference to May's Teo
                        Torriatte, from A Day at the Races. The idea of a guitar riff in
                        parallel sixths was re-used later in the Innuendo track, "The Hitman".



                        Dead on Time
"Dead on Time", written by May, features some of the fastest and most
                        aggressive guitar work by its author, as well as some
                        equally complicated yet ferocious drumming by Taylor. Performed at breakneck speed, it was
                        considered by most fans to be an ideal live number, but was curiously never played in concert;
                        May would only incorporate snippets of it in his guitar solos
                        during the Jazz Tour. The song resembles "Keep Yourself Alive" from Queen's
                        self-titled debut album. Particularly the guitar play is similar to that of Keep Yourself Alive,
                        although it's faster in "Dead on Time". In the
                        last chorus, the words "keep yourself alive" are sung, and in the lyrics attached to
                        the album, those words are written in capitals.

The song ends with the sound of a
                        thunderbolt, followed by Mercury screaming "You're
                        dead!" The thunderbolt was actually recorded by May on a portable recorder during a vicious
                        thunderstorm. Amusingly, the album's liner notes credit the thunderbolt to God.



                        In Only Seven Days
"In Only Seven Days"
                        resembles Deacon's previous song, "Spread Your Wings". Deacon also played
                        acoustic guitar and electric guitar.


 Dreamer's Ball
"Dreamer's
                        Ball" is May's tribute to Elvis Presley, who had died
                        one year before. The arrangement for the concert version was completely different, with May and
                        Taylor doing vocal brasses.


 Fun It
"Fun It" was a funk track with a
                        disco vibe by Taylor, where both Mercury and himself
                        shared the vocals. Taylor did the lead vocals, while Mercury was backup. Taylor used Syndrum
                        pads and played most of the instruments.


 Leaving Home Ain't Easy
"Leaving
                        Home Ain't Easy" was a ballad by May, who
                        also sang all the vocals (lead and harmony). His voice was sped up for the bridge.



                        Don't Stop Me Now
"Don't Stop Me Now" is Mercury's top 10 single in
                        the UK and is one of Queen's most famous songs.
                        May's only input is a short guitar solo and backing vocals.


 More of that
                        Jazz
"More of that Jazz" is yet another one of Taylor's bitter comments about
                        current society and the way rock and roll is disrespected.
                        It is loop based and Taylor plays most instruments and sings all vocals, reaching some very high
                        notes (peaking on a E5). The outro also contains short clips from many songs on the album,
                        including "Dead on Time", "Bicycle Race",
                        "Mustapha", "If You Can't Beat Them", "Fun It" and "Fat
                        Bottomed Girls".

 Singles
Four singles were released from the album:

"Bicycle Race"/"Fat
                        Bottomed Girls (edit)" – Elektra E45541; released October, 1978 
"Bicycle Race"
                        and "Fat Bottomed Girls" were
                        released in 1978 as a double A-side; the band staged a famous nude, all-female bicycle race to
                        promote the single. The bicycle race took place on 17th September 1978 at Wimbledon Stadium in
                        London. The picture sleeve showed a rear view of one of the
                        ladies on her bicycle, but in the U.S. a pair of red panties were painted on to avoid public
                        outcry. Legend has it that the band borrowed the bicycles from a store ("Halfords,"
                        according to the liner notes), but upon returning them were
                        informed that they would have to purchase all the seats, as they had been used in an improper
                        manner (i.e. without clothing). Fat Bottomed Girls also contains one of Roger Taylor's most
                        memorable drum fills at about 2:52 on the album Jazz, but
                        at 2:16 on greatest hits. 
"Mustapha" was released in 1978 in only Bolivia, Spain,
                        Yugoslavia and Germany. Its B-side was "Dead On Time" ("In Only Seven Days"
                        in Yugoslavia). 
"Don't Stop Me
                        Now"/"More Of That Jazz" – Elektra E46008; released February, 1979 
"Don't
                        Stop Me Now" was released in 1979; its B-side was "In Only Seven Days" ("More
                        Of That Jazz" in the USA and Canada).
                        
"Jealousy"/"Fun It" – Elektra E46039; released April, 1979 
"Jealousy"
                        was released in 1979 in the United States, New Zealand, Brazil, Russia, and Canada; its B-side
                        was "Fun It" ("Don't Stop
                        Me Now" in Russia, on a blue flexi disc).

					<content>News of the World is the sixth studio album by English rock band Queen, released in 1977.

Containing
                        hit songs "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions" and "Spread
                        Your Wings", the album went
                        platinum in the United Kingdom, four times platinum in the United States and achieved high
                        certifications elsewhere throughout the world also.

News of the World was the second
                        album to be produced solely by the band (the first being A Day at
                        the Races) and was recorded at Sarm West and Wessex Studios, England and co-produced and
                        engineered by Mike Stone.


 Background
After releasing A Day at the Races,
                        Queen's self-producing debut and followup to A Night at the
                        Opera which featured their magnum opus "Bohemian Rhapsody", having received some
                        criticism that Races was a "boring" album,[1] Queen decided to shift their musical
                        focus towards the mainstream, but remaining as the producers of
                        the next album. After completing the A Day at the Races Tour, the quartet re-entered the studio
                        to begin work on their sixth studio offering in July 1977, enlisting Mike Stone as assistant
                        producer at the Basing Street Studios in Wessex, London. The
                        group completed recording and production of the album two months later in September and released
                        the album on 28 October. Initially, the album's critical response was mixed, and some was
                        rather negative commenting that the group had again
                        produced a "bland" album; however as the singles for the album were released, the
                        reviews' favourability improved, and sales quickly improved.

During the recording
                        of the album, the Sex Pistols were recording their album Never
                        Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols in the next studio and Johnny Rotten was eager to
                        meet Mercury, so he crawled on all fours through Queen's studio, up to the side of the
                        piano where Mercury was playing, and said "Hello,
                        Freddie!" before crawling out.

Brian May describes News of the World as being a
                        "rootsier" album than previous Queen records, partly due to the punk scene breaking at
                        that time, which inspired Queen to record a more "back
                        to basics" rock album. News of the World is a less finely polished production than their
                        previous offerings. The complex vocal harmonies and guitar orchestrations that are used heavily
                        in earlier Queen albums are used much more sparingly and
                        subtly on this album.

Song
                        information

We Will Rock You
Main article: We Will Rock You
"We Will Rock
                        You" (Sample (info)) was released in the UK as a B-side to "We Are the Champions",
                        and became one of Queen's biggest songs worldwide.
                        A staple of arena and stadium sports everywhere, it was a conscious decision by Brian May to
                        make the song simple and anthemic ("stomp, stomp, clap, pause" in a 4/4 metre), so
                        that their live audience could be more directly involved in the
                        show. Elektra Records in the US recommended putting "We Will Rock You" and "We
                        Are the Champions" together as a single, and the double A-side reached #4 in the US in
                        1978. In the video for "We Will Rock You" and
                        "Spread Your Wings", May used a copy of his guitar. He supposedly didn't want to
                        commit his Red Special to outside conditions, as the videos for these songs featured the band
                        performing in the snow at Taylor's
                        garden.


We Are the Champions
Main article: We Are the Champions
According
                        to Freddie Mercury, "We Are the Champions" had been already written in 1975 but it
                        wasn't recorded until 1977.[3] Mercury was thinking
                        about football when he wrote it and was surprised that nobody composed anything to overtake it
                        as a sports anthem. "We Are the Champions" was the first promotional video for which
                        fan club members were invited to participate in the filming.
                        The video was filmed at the New London Theatre 6 October 1977. Everyone got a single and Queen
                        did a free concert after the shoot.


 Sheer Heart Attack
"Sheer Heart
                        Attack" was half-finished at the time of the eponymous
                        album. Roger Taylor sang lead on the demo but for the definitive version the band decided
                        Mercury should sing lead vocals (probably based on the fact that May had already sung two songs
                        and Taylor one). Guitars[citation needed] and bass were played
                        by Taylor, apart from some guitar "screams" by May during the instrumental section.

During
                        this time, the punk rock movement went into full effect, and this song was viewed as something
                        of a jab at the musicians who felt bands like
                        Queen were too self-indulgent. Of note is the lyric "I feel so inarticulate", and the
                        fact that Taylor stated in interviews that he thought many of the 1970s punk bands had very
                        little talent.

German Heavy metal band Helloween
                        covered the song. The cover can be heard as a B-side for their single "Just a Little Sign".



                        All Dead, All Dead
"All Dead, All Dead" was written and sung by May, and features
                        Mercury on backing vocals; May also
                        plays piano. Lyrically, the song deals with May's experiences following the death of his
                        childhood pet cat.


Spread Your Wings
Main article: Spread Your Wings
"Spread
                        Your Wings" (Sample (info)) was written by John
                        Deacon. The piano is played by Mercury, although Deacon mimes it in the music video. The video
                        was filmed at Roger Taylor's house at that time in his backyard, when the weather was
                        freezing, and the band was performing in the snow. Mercury can
                        be seen wearing star-shaped sunglasses in the video. Guitarist Brian May is seen playing a copy
                        of his Red Special due to the cold weather conditions. Also, drummer Roger Taylor can be seen
                        singing in the video despite there are no backing vocals in
                        the entire song. It was the first Queen single without harmony vocals.


Fight from
                        the Inside
"Fight from the Inside" was written and sung by Roger Taylor. In
                        addition to the drums, Taylor also plays rhythm and bass guitar,
                        the latter borrowed from Deacon himself.

The track is built around a jangly guitar riff
                        and is amongst the first in the Queen catalogue to focus predominantly on the drums and bass, as
                        opposed to the lead guitars. Lyrically, the song can be
                        interpreted as an expression of scorn directed at punk rock fans which at the time had lambasted
                        Queen 

Guitarist Slash has cited the guitar riff to this song as one of his favourite
                        riffs of all time.


 Get Down, Make
                        Love
"Get Down, Make Love", written by Mercury, is among the most sexual-oriented
                        songs in the Queen catalogue.

The distinctive 'psychedelic' sound effects
                        heard in the song were not produced on a synthesizer, but on
                        May's Red Special and an Electroharmonix Frequency Analyzer pedal, which he would often do
                        live. These sound effects, together with Mercury's moans and groans, were expanded upon
                        during live renditions of the song, presenting the band an
                        opportunity to show off the full potential of their stage lights and effects.

The song
                        was later covered by Nine Inch Nails, appearing on their "Sin" single.



                        Sleeping on the Sidewalk
"Sleeping On The
                        Sidewalk", written and sung by May, was inspired by Eric Clapton. It was recorded in one
                        take. Lyrically, it deals with an aspiring trumpet player's career, delivered in a "rags-to-riches"
                        fashion. May sings with an American
                        accent, providing some near-authentic blues credibility to the jam, and measures the
                        aforementioned trumpet player's success by "bucks" (as opposed to pounds). On a
                        close inspection, John Deacon can be heard playing the wrong notes in
                        some bass parts, and Brian May can also be heard laughing at the end of the song. It is also one
                        of the few Queen songs that does not feature Mercury.

The reason the song is so aloof
                        is because it was a first take. The band was not aware
                        they were being recorded at the time, and were simply practicing, while the engineer had turned
                        on the recording[4], but Brian May denied the authenticity of this.[5]


 Who Needs
                        You
"Who Needs You" was written by Deacon,
                        who, along with May, also plays Spanish guitar (also heard on "Innuendo"). May also
                        plays maracas and Mercury plays a cowbell. The song is fairly similar to Deacon's earlier
                        song "Misfire", in terms of music.



                        It's Late 
"It's Late", written by May, was the author's idea of
                        treating a song as a three-act theatrical play. It makes use of the tapping technique before
                        Eddie Van Halen of rock group Van Halen brought the technique
                        into the mainstream.


My Melancholy Blues
"My Melancholy Blues" was
                        composed by Mercury. There are no backing vocals or guitars. Despite the title, the track is
                        more related to jazz. Deacon played fretless bass on stage
                        during this song but used a regular fretted bass on the record.

Cover
 
Astounding Science
                        Fiction, October 1953The album's cover
                        was a painting by award-winning American sci-fi artist Frank Kelly Freas. Taylor had an issue of
                        Astounding Science Fiction (October 1953) whose cover-art depicted a giant intelligent robot
                        holding the dead body of a man. The caption read:
                        "Please... fix it, Daddy?" to illustrate the story "The Gulf Between" by Tom
                        Godwin. The robot killing the man was likened to a child injuring a bug and looking up at his
                        parents saying "what have I done?". The painting
                        inspired the band to contact Freas, who agreed to alter the painting for their album cover, by
                        replacing the single dead man with the four "dead" band members (Taylor and Deacon
                        falling to the ground). The original painting (also called The
                        Gulf Between) features on the cover of Freas's collection of art As He Sees It (Paper
                        Tiger, 2000).

Brian May confirmed the cover was Roger Taylor's idea on an episode
                        of the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard, which devoted
                        an episode to the making of News of the World.


Singles
"We Are the
                        Champions" released 7 October 1977 in the UK as the first single where it reached #2. In
                        the US, it was released as a Double A-side with "We Will Rock
                        You" where it reached #4. 
"Spread Your Wings" followed as the second single
                        from the album. Written by John Deacon and released in the UK on 10 February 1978, it reached
                        #34. 
"It's Late" is the last single from
                        the album and was only released as a single in the United States, Canada, Japan and New Zealand
                        in 1978. Only reached #74 in the US, failing to chart everywhere else. 

Reception

Critical
                        response
News of the World initially
                        received mixed reviews, mostly reflecting on the differences to the previously predominantly
                        progressive rock sound produced by Queen, and this album's vast shift towards a more
                        pop-rock oriented sound.[2] Following the immense success of
                        singles "We Will Rock You" and "We Are the Champions", the critical
                        reception shifted towards a more positive stance, as it became evident that the band was
                        displaying another field of their musical
                        ability.[1]

					<content>Queen is the debut album by English rock group Queen, released in July 1973. It was
                        recorded at Trident Studios and De Lane Lea Music Centre, London, with production by Roy Thomas
                        Baker (as Roy Baker), John Anthony, and Queen.

The
                        album was influenced by the seaside rock, hard rock, and heavy metal of the day and covers
                        subjects such as folklore ("My Fairy King") and religion ("Jesus"). Lead
                        singer Freddie Mercury composed five of the ten tracks. Lead
                        guitarist Brian May contributed four songs, including "Doing All Right" which was
                        co-written by Smile band-mate Tim Staffell. Drummer Roger Taylor composed and sang "Modern
                        Times Rock and Roll." The final song on the album is a
                        short instrumental version of "Seven Seas of Rhye". The band included the comment
                        'No synthesizers' on the album sleeve, as some listeners had mistaken their elaborate
                        multi-tracking and effects processed by guitar and vocal
                        sounds as synthesizers. Bassist John Deacon was credited on the sleeve notes of the original
                        vinyl release as "Deacon John", as Mercury and Taylor thought this may make him sound
                        more interesting.

Queen had been playing the club
                        and college circuit in and around London for almost two years when the band had a chance
                        opportunity to test out the new recording facilities of De Lane Lea Studios. Taking advantage of
                        the opportunity, they put together a polished demo tape of five
                        songs: "Keep Yourself Alive," "The Night Comes Down," "Great King Rat,"
                        "Jesus," and "Liar". Despite the demo tape's quality, the band received
                        only one offer from a record company - a low bid
                        from Chrysalis Records, which they used to try to entice other companies.

They were
                        finally taken aboard in 1972 by Norman and Barry Sheffield, who were setting up Trident Studios;
                        however, Queen were allowed to record only during the
                        studio's downtime, after the paying artists had left, which was usually between 3am and
                        7am. One day, while waiting to use the studio, Freddie Mercury was asked to record vocals by
                        producer Robin Cable, who was working on a version of "I
                        Can Hear Music" and "Goin' Back." Mercury enlisted Brian May and Roger
                        Taylor to record the tracks. These recordings were released on a single under the name Larry
                        Lurex.

The arrangement of recording only during downtime
                        lasted from June to November 1972. The limitations this imposed on them led the band to focus on
                        completing one track at a time, but problems arose almost immediately. The band had thought
                        highly of their De Lane Lea demo tracks, but producer Roy
                        Thomas Baker asked them to re-record the songs with better equipment. "Keep Yourself Alive"
                        was the first song to be re-recorded, and Queen did not like the result. They recorded it once
                        again, but during the mixing sessions, no mix met
                        their standards until engineer Mike Stone stepped in. After seven or eight failed attempts,
                        Stone's first try met with Queen's approval. Stone would stay on to engineer and
                        eventually co-produce their next five albums. The first, rejected
                        re-record of "Keep Yourself Alive" was later released by Hollywood Records in the
                        United States, titled "(Long Lost Re-take)," with Brian May's approval. Another
                        track that proved problematic was "Mad The Swine",
                        which was recorded for the album but then derailed by Baker and Queen disagreeing on the quality
                        of the percussion. With the issue unresolved, the track was left off the album. It re-surfaced
                        in 1991 as both the B-side to the "Headlong" CD
                        single in the UK, and on the Hollywood Records re-release of the album. The version of "The
                        Night Comes Down" which appears on the album is, in fact, the De Lane Lea demo recording,
                        as its quality was apparently up to the standards of the
                        rest of album's recordings.

Other recordings from this period, such as two Smile
                        tracks ("Silver Salmon" and "Polar Bear"), "Rock And Roll Medley"
                        (a live encore staple from the era), and the infamous track
                        "Hangman" (whose existence was long denied officially, beyond live concert
                        recordings), have surfaced in the form of acetate pressings, now owned legitimately by private
                        collectors.

Though the album was completed and fully mixed by
                        November 1972, Trident spent months trying to get a record company to release it. After eight
                        months of failing that, they simply released it themselves in 1973. During this time, Queen had
                        begun writing material for their next album, but they were
                        disheartened by the current album's delay, feeling they had grown past that stage, even
                        though the record-buying public was just getting wind of them. They recorded two BBC sessions
                        during the interim. The first single, "Keep Yourself
                        Alive" (the Mike Stone mix, now considered the standard album version) was released a week
                        before the album (UK dates, 6 July and 13th respectively). The track length was edited for
                        release in the US, from 3:47 to 3:30. The US single was issued
                        in October. All countries had the B-side "Son And Daughter". The album was released in
                        the US on 4 September.

Elektra Records released a single of "Liar" in a
                        heavily edited form (without the band's knowledge) on 14
                        February 1974, with the B-side "Doing All Right". Elektra later re-issued the edited
                        version of "Keep Yourself Alive" in July of 1975, this time with the rare double
                        B-side (rare for a 7" single) of "Lily Of The
                        Valley" and "God Save the Queen". Both versions are unique compared to the album
                        versions.

Hollywood Records released a CD single featuring five versions of "Keep
                        Yourself Alive" to promote the forthcoming
                        "Crown Jewels" boxed set (1998). The versions on the CD are: "Long Lost Re-take",
                        "BBC Session #1 Version", "Live Killers Version", "Album Version
                        (Unremastered)", and "Album Version (1998
                        Remastered Version)". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Queen"&gt;Read

					<content>The Game is a rock album by English band Queen released June 30, 1980. It was the only
                        Queen album to reach the #1 position in both the United Kingdom and the United States and became
                        Queen's best selling studio album in the US with
                        four million copies sold to date, tying News of the World's US sales tally. Notable songs
                        on the album include the bass driven "Another One Bites the Dust" and the rockabilly
                        "Crazy Little Thing Called Love", both of which
                        reached number 1 in the United States. The Game was the first Queen album to use a synthesizer
                        (an Oberheim OB-X). The album's working title was "Play the Game", but Taylor
                        voiced concern about its possible overtones of conformity, so
                        it was changed to simply "The Game".

Compared to previous Queen albums, the
                        song arrangements are much simpler[2] (the album's sound is more "pop rock"
                        rather than the progressive/hard rock hybrids of Queen's
                        previous albums) but the album is responsible for propelling the band into global megastars.[3]
                        Although the album was recorded over an 11-month period at separate sessions, the album is
                        described as having a "slick cohesive feel" to it.[4]
                        At approximately 35 minutes, The Game is the shortest of Queen's studio albums.

Re-issued
                        in May 2003 on DVD-Audio with Dolby 5.1 surround sound and DTS 5.1. The 5.1 mix of "Coming
                        Soon" features an alternate backing track,
                        because the final master tapes were not found when mixing the album to 5.1.

The photo
                        on the cover of the EMI CD is different from that originally used on the LP and cassette even
                        though the Hollywood CD still has the original photo. The
                        original photo (with Taylor having folded arms and May not having a hand resting upon his
                        exposed hip) is shown in the article. This alternate photo was also used on cover of the DTS
                        DVD-Audio edition of the album released in
                        2003.

Song information

Play the Game
Main article:
                        Play the Game (song)
Mercury wrote "Play the Game" after breaking up with his male
                        lover at the time. Mercury played piano and sang the lead
                        vocals. Mercury started smoking cigarettes around this time--creating his husky tenor for the
                        rest of the decade (Though he dropped the habit by 1990 due to his AIDS-related complications).
                        The music video for this song marked the first time Freddie
                        appeared on film with his trademark moustache.


 Dragon Attack
"Dragon
                        Attack" was a jam session by band members and crew, to which May added lyrics and the idea
                        of alternating solos (drums, bass, guitar, and an almost a
                        cappella chorus). The melody is similar to "We Will Rock You": compare "buddy you're
                        a boy make a big noise" with "take me to the room where the red's all red".
                        This song and Another One Bites the Dust are the
                        two funk rock songs on the album. This song was only performed live in a shorter form, until the
                        US leg of the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour, where the entire song was played. It's also the
                        theme song for WWE Legend, Ricky "The Dragon"
                        Steamboat.


Another One Bites the Dust
Main article: Another One Bites the Dust
Deacon
                        wrote "Another One Bites the Dust" about cowboys, but then changed it to make it more
                        suitable to the band. Mercury loved it and was
                        instrumental in its inclusion on the album. Their roadies told them it'd be a good idea to
                        release it as a single but they didn't believe them. According to Brian May and Roger
                        Taylor on a 1991 interview with American DJ Redbeard on the
                        show In the Studio with Redbeard about making of The Game, Michael Jackson ultimately convinced
                        the band to release it as a single. They did it and it became their second #1 hit in the US. The
                        song doesn't have any synths, the strange sounds
                        were achieved via reversed pianos, and May's Red Special guitar through an Eventide
                        harmoniser. It stayed at number one for three weeks in the United States. It is the only song to
                        ever top the Billboard rock, dance, and R&amp;B charts
                        simultaneously selling over 7 million copies in the United States.


 Need Your
                        Loving Tonight
"Need Your Loving Tonight" was the other song by Deacon. Very
                        Beatles-influenced in the melody (the "Oh, I need your
                        loving" chorus is similar to "Eight Days a Week"), although it has a rocking
                        guitar riff, giving the song a more power pop sound. Deacon played both rhythm and acoustic
                        guitar as well as bass. On the live versions May sang backing
                        vocals and Mercury played piano (both absent in the studio version). The song was released as a
                        single in November 1980 and peaked at #44 in the US.


 Crazy Little Thing Called
                        Love
"Crazy Little Thing Called Love" was the
                        band's first #1 single in the United States. It is the last rockabilly song to be number
                        one. Mercury started it in the bathroom in June 1979 and then wrote the chords using his Martin
                        D18 acoustic guitar. He recorded it with Taylor and Deacon
                        after having some drinks, and the entire session lasted about half an hour. Shortly before
                        releasing it as a single, May added backing vocals and a guitar solo using Taylor's Fender
                        Telecaster instead of his Red Special. There are no
                        synthesizers. It was the first time that Mercury's guitar playing made it onto a Queen
                        record. Brian played a black telecaster in the video and live because Taylor's guitar was
                        stolen.


[Rock It (Prime Jive)
"Rock It
                        (Prime Jive)" was composed by Taylor, and it caused controversy in the band. Producer Mack
                        and May suggested it'd sound better with Mercury on vocals. They demoed both versions and
                        Deacon preferred Taylor's version. Finally they
                        decided to leave Mercury doing the intro and Taylor singing the rest. Taylor plays rhythm guitar
                        and bass, Mercury plays organ and Mack plays synth on this track.


 Don't Try
                        Suicide
"Don't Try Suicide" is a song
                        by Mercury including some slap-bass playing by John Deacon and piano parts by Mercury. No
                        synthesizers were used. It is rhythmically based upon 1950's classic rock.


[
                        Sail Away Sweet Sister (To the Sister I Never
                        Had)
"Sail Away Sweet Sister (To the Sister I Never Had)" was composed by Brian
                        May. May sings the verses and choruses, Mercury took over the vocals for the middle eight. This
                        song is based on the soft vocals by Brian May, it's
                        tenure feeling and the sweet melodies on guitar and bass.

During the Use Your Illusion
                        Tour ('91-'93), singer Axl Rose of Guns N' Roses would often sing the chorus of
                        this song as an intro to "Sweet Child o'
                        Mine".


 Coming Soon
"Coming Soon" is Taylor's song, sung
                        as duet between Mercury and himself, and featuring Taylor on rhythm guitar. It originated from
                        the Jazz album sessions in 1978, although only a glimpse can
                        be heard in the early demo from the final version.


 Save Me
Main article: Save
                        Me (Queen song)
Brian May wrote "Save Me" about a friend whose relationship had
                        ended, and played piano, synths and guitars (electric and
                        twelve-string acoustic) on it. This song, "Sail Away Sweet Sister", "Coming Soon"
                        and "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" were recorded in 1979, the rest of the album was
                        done in 1980.

				<content>Queen were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass guitarist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor.

The band formed in London in 1970 after May and
        Taylor's former band Smile split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. 

There was much deliberation as to what the band's
        name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C.S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet.

Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie's. Originally Roger and,
        especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was "right" for the band.

"Years ago I thought up the name Queen... It's just a name, but it's very regal, and it
        sounds splendid. It's a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. "
-
        Freddie Mercury.

Queen went through several bass players before a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. 

"Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they
        musically worked they'd look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn't play. - Brian May.

This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started
        playing we realized it was right." - Brian May.

Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album -
        Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down. The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow
        Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. 

It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though
        after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they
        reached their ultimate goal of "perfection".

Queen's self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, "Queen
        II" which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album's single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band's mimed appearance on Top of the Pops.
        

The band's second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a "concept album", split into "White Side" vs. "Black
        Side". 

As was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act
        for Mott the Hoople.

Sheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some
        hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band's rigorous touring schedule. 

Sheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May's Now I'm
        Here and the song that would be the band's "turning point", the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts.

During this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and
        witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album "A Night At The Opera", featuring the epic "Bohemian Rhapsody".

Queen's
        popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their "Live Aid" appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury's untimely
        death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.

Over the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films ("Flash Gordon" and "Highlander"),
        released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world.

In 1995, 4 years after Mercury's death, the band released the album "Made In Heaven". This album saw the surviving band members in the
        studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material (a Queen version of "I Was Born To Love You" for example), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song ("Mother
        Love"). 

Queen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire.


Several "Queen + ..." projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic
        involvement from the band. In 1999, a "Greatest Hits III" album was released. This featured, among others, "Queen + Wyclef Jean" on a rap version of "Another One Bites the Dust", a live version of "Somebody to
        Love" performed by George Michael, and a live version of "The Show Must Go On" performed live in 1997 with Elton John.

Brian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions (award ceremonies, charity
        concerts, and the like), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen's hits with guest vocalists, including "We Will Rock You" (first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John
        Farnham and P!nk) and "We Are the Champions" (with Robbie Williams).

On the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical 'We Will Rock You' opened in the Dominion theatre in London's 'West End'. A Musical about young
        people in the distant future who aren't allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere
        evening.

At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May's website also stated that Rodgers would
        be 'featured with' Queen as 'Queen + Paul Rodgers', not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating.

Between 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe
        and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a "secret
        location". The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv's Freedom
        Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD.

Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together
        again.

                        first day sales of 85,000 outsold the rest of the Top 20
                        combined, while all twelve tracks from the album entered the top 200 of the UK Singles Chart in
                        their own right. In the USA, the album debuted at number seven, selling around 44,000 copies in
                        its first week. The album has since gone 2x platinum in
                        the UK and the album was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize. At the 2008 BRIT Awards it won
                        Best British Album. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/Favourite+Worst+Nightmare"&gt;Read

					<summary>Humbug is the third studio album by the Sheffield-based band Arctic Monkeys. The album was
                        co-produced by Josh Homme (Queens of the Stone Age) and James Ford (Simian Mobile Disco), who
                        had previously worked with the band on Favourite Worst
                        Nightmare. 

It was recorded in early 2009 in New York City, Los Angeles and Josh Hommes'
                        Rancho de la Luna in the Mojave Desert, California.

Early soundbites of tracks from the
                        album appeared in the band's periodical video
                        diary on YouTube. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/Humbug"&gt;Read

					<summary>Suck It and See is the fourth studio album by English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys,
                        released 6 June 2011 in the UK and 7 June in the US, following their 2011 North American tour.
                        The band worked with producer James Ford on this album and
                        promised a more "vintage" style. The music video for "Brick by Brick" was
                        released shortly before the album details were revealed on March 10. Drummer Matt Helders,
                        however, confirmed that "Brick by Brick" will not be
                        the lead single. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/Suck+It+and+See"&gt;Read

                        See will feature "some songs a bit more instant. A bit more poppy, certainly, than Humbug
                        was." &lt;a

					<summary>Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not is the debut album by Sheffield
                        band Arctic Monkeys, released on 23 January 2006. The album became the fastest selling debut
                        album in the UK since Definitely Maybe by Oasis. The album
                        sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis's
                        album Spirit. It has since gone quadruple platinum in the UK, and won the 2006 Mercury Prize.

The
                        album includes both tracks from the
                        band's original EP &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Arctic+Monkeys/Whatever+People+Say+I+Am,+That%27s+What+I%27m+Not"&gt;Read

				<content>Arctic Monkeys are an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O'Malley (backing
        vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.

The band has released five studio albums, "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" (2006), "Favourite Worst
        Nightmare" (2007), "Humbug" (2009), "Suck It and See" (2011) and "AM" (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. 

Each of the band's first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the
        Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at
        #12.

The band's rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a
        growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk, which the band recognizes on their website. The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical 'commercial'
        channels, including refusing to appear on the UK's (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success.

The band's debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,
        held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to
        Leona Lewis's album Spirit.

On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to 'fatigue' and the other band members
        couldn't stand the constant 'missing his girlfriend syndrome' so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist, Nick O'Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band's remaining summer commitments. He
        was then announced as Nicholson's permanent replacement. 

The single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1
        single.

Their debut album "Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not" won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades.

Their second
        album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by "Brianstorm", the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, "Favourite Worst Nightmare" sold more than
        the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week.

When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, "We haven't changed
        that much. It's still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls".

The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said "We had tunes that we'd already been
        playing on tour so we recorded them. That’s six [songs]. We’re going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff."

The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of
        New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington's Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were "Crying
        Lightning", "Go-Kart", "Dangerous Animals" and "Pretty Visitors." The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song "Red Right Hand." During their
        last tour, the band had played new songs "Put Me In A Terror Pocket", "Sandtrap," and "The Fire and The Thud" live.

Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals,
        Miles Kane.
The band is called 'The Last Shadow Puppets'

The band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single " Crying Lightning"

They released their fourth studio album,
        entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011

					<summary>The sexiest album of 2012 just got an upgrade. The Parade Edition of Lana Del Rey’s, debut
                        LP, Born to Die, includes all 12 original tracks, plus the deluxe edition’s three bonus cuts.
                        Add to this a generous nine extra songs that were
                        previously unreleased. The opening single, “Ride”, plays like an orchestral continuation of her
                        debut. Over lush string arrangements and ether-soaked backing vocals, Del Rey coos in her
                        languorous tenor with a regal sleepiness–as if she tracked her

					<content>The sexiest album of 2012 just got an upgrade. The Parade Edition of Lana Del Rey’s, debut
                        LP, Born to Die, includes all 12 original tracks, plus the deluxe edition’s three bonus cuts.
                        Add to this a generous nine extra songs that were
                        previously unreleased. The opening single, “Ride”, plays like an orchestral continuation of her
                        debut. Over lush string arrangements and ether-soaked backing vocals, Del Rey coos in her
                        languorous tenor with a regal sleepiness–as if she tracked her
                        vocals from a fainting couch. Even when hitting a falsetto during the closing chorus, Del Rey
                        sounds medicated and aloof. This seeps into “Body Electric”, where she sings like a film noir
                        starlet on her deathbed. Her intentionally demure vocal style
                        fits the hauting cover of “Blue Velvet”, like an elegantly tailored prom dress from the ’50s.
                        Whi an eerie period-correct mix, this arresting version of the songs begs for David Lynch to
                        direct either prequel of sequel to his 1986 mystery film of the
                        same name. Del Rey’s weakness for bad boys extends to the sultry closer, “Burning Desire.” &lt;a

					<summary>Before Lana Del Rey had officially released a single song, her buzz was massive thanks to
                        an enchanting viral video (“Video Games”) that attracted tens of millions of viewers.
                        Approximately six months later, Del Rey released her debut album,
                        Born to Die, which is filled with torch songs influenced by hip-hop. She wrote and recorded the

                        modern music collections alongside ADELE, Amy Winehouse, and Erykah Badu. There’s no denying
                        these noir-shaded numbers—many of which are built on orchestral accouterments and subtle vocal
                        samples reminiscent of Kanye West productions. Del Rey’s husky
                        narrative lingers like smoke clouds, leaving wafts of rhythmic phrasings delivered by an icy,
                        heartbroken femme fatale. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Born+to+Die"&gt;Read

					<summary>The spine-tingling magic of Lana Del Rey’s Ultraviolence lies in the album’s striking,
                        sudden contrasts—moments, as on “West Coast”, when Del Rey’s cool detachment wells up into a
                        wail of emotional anguish. Recorded at Dan Auerbach’s Easy
                        Eye Sound in Nashville and produced by Auerbach himself, Ultraviolence is an assertive follow-up
                        to Del Rey’s 2012 breakthrough, Born to Die. Musing on dark themes—the corruption of power,
                        money, and of course, violence—Del Rey offers a hypnotic set
                        of darkly tempered songs. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Ultraviolence"&gt;Read

                        stylist prowess, as are the doleful “Brooklyn Baby” and the disarming and cinematic “Shades of
                        Cool.”

					<content>A Girl Like Me is the second studio album by Barbadian R&amp;B/ pop singer Rihanna. It was
                        released through Def Jam Records on April 19, 2006 in Japan, on April 24 in the United Kingdom,
                        and on April 25 in the United States. For the
                        production of the album, Rihanna worked with Evan Rogers, Carl Sturken, Stargate and J. R. Rotem
                        with label-mate Ne-Yo who wrote the album's second single. Musically, the album
                        incorporates a combination of pop, reggae and ballad elements which
                        received mixed reviews by music critics.

Some critics gave the album positive reviews
                        stating that she gracefully avoids the sophomore disappointment while others compared the album
                        to her previous effort. A Girl Like Me was released less
                        than eight months after her debut album. It peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200
                        album chart and on the UK Albums Chart. The album was successful in other Countries, entering
                        the top ten in Ireland, New Zealand, Australia and Japan while
                        topping the charts in Canada on the Canadian Albums Chart.

A Girl Like Me spawned four
                        singles; "SOS", which became her first single to reach number-one on the Billboard Hot
                        100, "Unfaithful" and "Break It Off",
                        both reaching the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100, however, the third single, "We Ride",
                        failed to reprise the success of the previous singles. The album was re-released as an expanded
                        double-disc deluxe package in Germany, which includes
                        her previous hit single, "Pon de Replay". The album has been certified platinum by the
                        Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/A+Girl+Like+Me"&gt;Read

                        U.S. Billboard Hot 100.

The album was re-released in June 2008, a year after its
                        original release, under the title Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded. The
                        double-disc deluxe edition package includes three new singles: the U.S., Canadian and UK
                        number-one "Take a Bow", "If I Never See Your Face Again" (which debuted at
                        number fifty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100) and
                        "Disturbia", which became the third single from the album to reach number one on the
                        Billboard Hot 100. The album has been certified two times Platinum by the RIAA, denoting
                        shipments to U.S. retailers of two million copies. &lt;a

					<content>Loud is the fifth studio album by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna, first released on
                        November 12, 2010 by Def Jam Recordings. The album was recorded between February and August
                        2010, predominantly during Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth
                        Tour and filming for her first feature film Battleship (2012). Rihanna was executive producer on
                        the album and worked with several record producers, including StarGate, The Runners, Polow da
                        Don, Tricky Stewart, and Alex da Kid, among others. The
                        album featured several guest vocalists, including Drake, Nicki Minaj and Eminem, who is featured
                        on the sequel to "Love the Way You Lie", "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)",
                        where Rihanna sang lead vocals. Britney Spears appears on
                        the remix of the single version of "S&amp;M" , although she is not on the album
                        version.
The album differed from Rihanna's previous release, Rated R (2009), which
                        featured a prominently foreboding and angry tone with dark themes
                        and incorporated elements of hip hop, rock, and dubstep music genres. Loud features up-tempo and
                        pop genres, ranging from dance-pop to Electro-R&amp;B, and marked her return to her dancehall
                        roots, which was prominent on her earlier albums Music of
                        the Sun (2005) and A Girl like Me (2006). The album also incorporates rock in "California
                        King Bed" and reggae in the Caribbean inspired "Man Down".
Loud received
                        generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented
                        its upbeat material and Rihanna's vocal performances, with some critics calling it "...brilliantly
                        sassy and exuberant at times" and praised "...the subtle West Indian flavor."
                        However, some critics found the album to be
                        "slapdash" and "...an unfocused assortment of poor-to-solid songs than a unified
                        set." The album debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first week
                        sales of 207,000 copies, the highest first week sales of her
                        career to date. The album debuted at number one on the Canadian and Swiss Albums Chart. In the
                        United Kingdom, the album reached number one on the UK Albums Chart and was the fourth
                        best-selling album of 2010, although it was released at the end of
                        November that year. Loud was a commercial success internationally, and peaked at number one in
                        Canada, Ireland, Japan, Norway, Scotland and Switzerland, and reached the Top 5 Australia,
                        Denmark, France and Germany.
The album produced seven
                        singles, including the international hits "Only Girl (In the World)", "What's
                        My Name?", and "S&amp;M". All three singles reached number one on the US
                        Billboard Hot 100. "S&amp;M" was Rihanna's tenth
                        US number one song, making Rihanna the youngest recording artist to accumulate ten number one
                        songs in the shortest time, surpassing Mariah Carey's record. In the United Kingdom "Only
                        Girl (In the World)" and "What's My
                        Name?" peaked at number one, whilst "S&amp;M" peaked at number three. "Only
                        Girl (In the World)" won the Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in February 2011. To
                        support the album, Rihanna embarked on her third worldwide
                        concert tour, entitled the Loud Tour. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Loud"&gt;Read

					<content>Talk That Talk is the sixth studio album by Barbadian singer Rihanna, released on November
                        18, 2011, by Def Jam Recordings and SRP Records. It was recorded while traveling for the Loud
                        Tour between February and November 2011, and was
                        originally planned to be a reissue of her previous studio album Loud (2010). As executive
                        producer, Rihanna enlisted a wide range of producers including Alex da Kid, Mr. Bangladesh,
                        Calvin Harris, Chase &amp; Status, Cirkut, Da Internz, Dr. Luke,
                        Ester Dean, Gareth McGrillen, Hit-Boy, No I.D., Priscilla Renea, Rob Swire, StarGate, The-Dream.
                        Following in the same vein as Loud, Talk That Talk is a dance-oriented pop/R&amp;B crossover
                        album that incorporates elements of hip hop, dubstep,
                        electronic and house music. The album also continues to have subtle dancehall genres, whilst its
                        lyrical content and themes revolve around a nihilist, romantic and lascivious lover.

Talk
                        That Talk received generally positive reviews from
                        music critics, and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of
                        198,000 copies. As of June 2015, the album has sold 1.15 million copies in the United States.
                        The album peaked at number one in Austria, New Zealand, Norway,
                        Switzerland and the United Kingdom, where it debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,
                        selling 163,000 copies in its first week. As of April 2012, the album has been certified
                        three-times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for
                        shipments of 900,000 copies.

The lead single "We Found Love" became Rihanna's
                        eleventh number-one song US Billboard Hot 100, and topped the charts in 26 additional countries.
                        "You da One", "Talk That Talk"
                        (featuring rapper Jay Z) and a remix of "Birthday Cake" (featuring Chris Brown)
                        experienced moderate success, while "Where Have You Been" reached the top ten of
                        twenty countries around the world. A remixed form of "Cockiness
                        (Love It)" (featuring rapper A$AP Rocky) was released as the sixth and final single from
                        the record. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/Talk+That+Talk"&gt;Read more

				<content>Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Bajan singer. Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel
        her to superstar status. She has attained fourteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados.

Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to
        Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant. Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty. She began
        singing at around the age of seven. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father's addiction to crack cocaine and parent's rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old. Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a
        primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen. In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant. She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that
        trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant.

At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates. In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who
        was vacationing in Barbados with his wife. The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that "the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn't exist." While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang
        Destiny's Child's cover of "Emotion". Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with
        Rogers and his wife. Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad "The Last Time," a cover of Whitney Houston’s hit "For the Love of You" and what would become her first hit, "Pon de
        Replay" to send to various recording companies. It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna's demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her
        to audition for the label's then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her.

Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single "Pon de
        Replay". Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, "SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track "Tainted Love". "Unfaithful" was also released and was fairly
        successful.

Rihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo. She adopted a more sexual image while recording the
        album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album
        compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, "I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time. You feel different every album, and [at] this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo
        [songs]."

The album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia. Unlike previous work, the album featured a more
        dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts.

It yielded eight hit singles -
        "Umbrella" "Shut Up and Drive", "Don't Stop The Music" "Hate That I Love You" "Rehab" "Disturbia" "Take A Bow" "If I Never See Your Face Again" - all singles
        reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 — including the worldwide number-one hit "Umbrella," featuring Jay-Z. 

In addition to reaching number one in various countries, "Umbrella" was the number one single in the
        United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet's single "Love Is All Around" spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of
        2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine. In 2008, "Umbrella" earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at
        number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart.

"Umbrella" has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed
        number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine's list of
        the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine's poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers' Poll 2007. The music press has considered "Umbrella" as 2007's
        Song of the Summer, while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as "arguably 2007's signature slow jam".

In August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on "Run This Town." The song
        peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue. The shoot was influenced by Rihanna's hair, which she had cut for the shoot
        into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude. Rihanna performed "Run This Town" along with Jay-Z and West for the "Answer the Call" concert at Madison
        Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed "Run This Town," on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009.

In November of 2009,
        "Rated R" was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album's lead single, "Russian Roulette" -- written with Ne-Yo - was one of the
        year's most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP.

One year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called "Loud'. It's lead single, "Only Girl
        (In the World)", reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording.

"Talk That Talk" was released one year after "Loud". With the song "We Found Love",
        Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart's history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. "You Da
        One" became the second single from the album but was not as successful as "We Found Love". The third single from the album, "Talk That Talk" featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna's Twitter. The fourth single,
        "Where Have You Been", peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100.


On February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the "Talk That Talk" album track "Birthday Cake" and
        the other featuring Chris Brown's "Turn Up The Music"

In April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie "Battleship", which is based on the game of the same name.

Rihanna's seventh album, Unapologetic was
        released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna's twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the
        fourth-most number ones in the chart's history.

On January 28, 2016, Rihanna released her eighth studio album Anti exclusively through streaming service Tidal. The album peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200, becoming
        Rihanna's second number one and eighth top ten album on the chart. The album was supported by the release of four singles including the lead single "Work" featuring Drake, which topped the Billboard Hot 100. Further platinum singles
        "Needed Me" and "Love on the Brain" both peaked inside the top ten of the Hot 100. In 2016, Rihanna was featured on several singles. The first collaboration was Calvin Harris' "This Is What You Came For," which
        reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the United Kingdom. Rihanna was also featured on Drake's "Too Good" from his album Views and Mike Will Made It's single, "Nothing Is Promised". On June 27,
        2016, Rihanna released "Sledgehammer", the lead single from the Star Trek Beyond soundtrack. On August 28, Rihanna was honored with the MTV Video Vanguard Award at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards. &lt;a

					<content>Bleach is the debut album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It was released on June 15,
                        1989 through the independent record label Sub Pop. Bleach originally sold a mere 30,000 copies,
                        but following the enormous success of the band's
                        second album, Nevermind (1991), fans discovered Nirvana's obscure debut. It has since been
                        certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, making it one of only two
                        albums released on Sub Pop to have received platinum
                        certification.

The main sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording Studios
                        in Seattle, Washington, with local producer Jack Endino manning the board. Nirvana began
                        recording with a five hour session on December 24, 1988. The band
                        recorded again on December 29-31, and on January 14 and 24. Ultimately Endino billed the group
                        for 30 hours of recording time. Three of the album's songs–"Floyd the Barber",
                        "Paper Cuts", and the CD-only track
                        "Downer"–were recorded during a previous session at Reciprocal Studios in 1988,
                        featuring Dale Crover on drums. Despite attempts to re-record them with new drummer Chad
                        Channing, the band ultimately decided to remix the versions recorded
                        with Crover for the final version of Bleach. "Big Long Now" was omitted from the album
                        because vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain felt "there was already enough slow heavy stuff on
                        Bleach, and he "didn't want that song to go
                        out", according to Endino. The album was edited and sequenced, but Sub Pop head Bruce
                        Pavitt ordered that the album be completely resequenced. The record was further delayed for
                        several months until Sub Pop was able to secure sufficient funds to
                        issue it.

The recording sessions were completed with a cost of $606. Jason Everman, a
                        guitarist who was impressed by the band's demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He
                        briefly joined Nirvana as a second guitarist. Everman is
                        credited (removed on deluxe reissue) as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other
                        guitarist on the cover of the album, even though he did not perform on the record. Bassist Krist
                        Novoselic explained, "We just wanted to make him feel at
                        home in the band."The information above is incorrect in regards to the release date of
                        "Bleach".
The singles, "Love Buzz/Big Cheese" were released in 1988 on
                        the Sub Pop Label; followed by the 1989 release of the album,
                        "Bleach". According to the album sleeve it cost a whopping $606.17 to record, supplied
                        by Jason Everman (who was fired after their first US tour). 
After becoming disenchanted
                        with Sub Pop they then signed with DGC/Geffen in 1990 and in
                        1991 they released "Nevermind" (After the album's release members of Nirvana
                        expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given the album). Everyone knows
                        how things went after this point, so there's no point in
                        my continued writing.

According to Cobain, the music on Bleach conformed with the
                        grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed. "There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge
                        scene to play 'rock music'," Cobain said.
                        "Strip it down and make it sound like Aerosmith." Cobain felt he had to fit the
                        expectations of the grunge sound in order to build a fanbase, and so he purposefully suppressed
                        his arty and pop songwriting traits when crafting the record.
                        Krist Novoselic noted in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in
                        their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and an album by the
                        black metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that
                        the combination probably played an influence as well.

Cobain told Spin in 1993 that
                        with Bleach "I didn't give a flying fuck what the lyrics were about," and claimed
                        that eighty percent of the lyrics were written the night
                        before recording. Cobain often was still working on them on the drive to the recording studio.
                        He explained, "It was like I'm pissed off. Don't know what about. Let's just
                        scream negative lyrics, and as long as they're not
                        sexist and don't get too embarrassing it'll be okay. I don't hold any of those
                        lyrics dear to me." Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that nevertheless many of the
                        songs on the album were reflective of Cobain and various
                        incidents in his life. "Mr. Moustache" was inspired by Cobain's dislike of macho
                        behavior, while "School" was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub
                        Pop.

Sub Pop pressed the first 1,000 copies on
                        white vinyl, the next 2,000 on black, and all subsequent pressings were on red and blue. The
                        first 3,000 copies of the record came with a poster, featuring Jason Everman. The vinyl
                        pressings omitted "Big Cheese" or "Downer". In
                        the United Kingdom, the record was released on Tupelo Records in June 1989. The first 300 Tupelo
                        copies were pressed on white vinyl; the next 2,000 copies were on dark green. The rest of the
                        Tupelo copies were on black vinyl. The Tupelo copies did
                        contain "Love Buzz", but "Big Cheese" was listed on the label and sleeve
                        instead. They also did not contain "Downer". In Australia, Bleach was released on
                        Waterfront Records and later re-issued on various colored covers
                        and colored vinyl prior to 1992. Sub Pop released a remastered version of the album on CD and
                        cassette in April 1992.

For the 20th anniversary of the album, Sub Pop released a
                        deluxe reissue of Bleach featuring a March 2009 remastering from
                        the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at Portland, Oregon's
                        Pine Street Theatre.

The album's working title was Too Many Humans. It was renamed
                        Bleach after Cobain found an AIDS prevention poster
                        while Nirvana was driving through San Francisco. The poster advised heroin addicts to bleach
                        their needles before use, featuring the slogan "Bleach Your Works." &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Bleach"&gt;Read

					<content>In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American alternative rock band Nirvana,
                        released on September 21, 1993 by DGC Records. Following the success of the group's 1991
                        breakthrough album Nevermind, Nirvana sought to avoid
                        that album's polished production and hired recording engineer Steve Albini to produce the
                        record. The band recorded In Utero with Albini in two weeks in February 1993, capturing an
                        abrasive and naturalistic sound for the record. While some of
                        the songs had been written years prior, the lyrics largely dealt with frontman Kurt Cobain's
                        reflections on his newfound fame and recent personal troubles, incorporating imagery of sickness
                        and disease.

Soon after recording was
                        completed, controversy erupted as news reports stated that DGC did not like the band's
                        sessions with Albini and refused to release the album, deeming it uncommercial. Nirvana denied
                        the statements but were also not fully satisfied with the sound
                        Albini captured. The band ultimately made some minor changes to the album's sound and hired
                        producer Scott Litt to mix the singles "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies".
                        Upon its release, In Utero debuted at number one on
                        the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The
                        record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America,
                        and has sold over four million copies in the United
                        States.

To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to
                        promoting In Utero; the company's head of marketing told Billboard before the album's
                        release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar
                        to that of Nevermind, and explained that the label would "set things up, duck, and get out
                        of the way". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released
                        the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. In
                        contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Utero's singles
                        commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single "Heart-Shaped
                        Box" to American college, modern rock, and
                        album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40
                        radio. Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as
                        successful as Nevermind. Cobain told Jim DeRogatis,
                        "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally
                        comfortable with that because we like this record so much."

In Utero was released
                        on September 13, 1993 in the United Kingdom, and on September
                        14 in the United States; it was initially only available in vinyl record and cassette tape
                        formats, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was
                        issued on compact disc in the UK on September 14, a full domestic
                        release did not occur until September 21. In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200
                        album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores
                        Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell the album. According to
                        The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand,
                        while Kmart representatives explained that the album "didn't fit within our
                        merchandise mix". In truth, both chains feared that customers
                        would be offended by the artwork on the album's back cover. DGC issued a new version of the
                        album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album
                        artwork, and listed the name of "Rape Me" as
                        "Waif Me". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the
                        packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain
                        stores; as a result they "really want to make their music
                        available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".

In
                        Utero received acclaim from critics. Time's Christopher John Farley stated in his review of
                        the album, "Despite the fears of some
                        alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may
                        once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote,
                        "In Utero is a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive,
                        enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of
                        the will." Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne (who gave the album a rating of B+)
                        commented "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted
                        that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, "The music is often mesmerizing,
                        cathartic rock &amp; roll, but it is rock &amp; roll without release, because the band is
                        suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would
                        evoke." NME gave the album an eight out of ten rating. However, reviewer John Mulvey had
                        doubts about the record; he concluded, "As a document of a mind in flux — dithering,
                        dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity — Kurt should be
                        proud of [the album]. As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just
                        isn't quite there." Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the
                        album's more abrasive songs, "In Utero is beautiful
                        far more often than it is ugly", and added, "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the
                        unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." Critics ranked In Utero as one
                        of the best releases of the year. It placed first and
                        second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop year-end
                        critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of
                        the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for
                        Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.

That October, Nirvana embarked
                        on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release
                        that featured "All Apologies" and "Rape
                        Me", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg
                        of the tour in February 1994, but it was cancelled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome
                        on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation,
                        but the singer went missing soon afterwards, and on April 8 he was found dead in his Seattle
                        home as the result of suicide by a shotgun blast. The intended third single from In Utero,
                        "Pennyroyal Tea", was cancelled in the wake of
                        Cobain's death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were
                        released in Britain. Three days after Cobain's body was discovered, In Utero moved back up
                        the Billboard charts, from number 72 to number
                        27.

In the ensuing years, In Utero has continued to perform commercially and gather
                        critical praise. In a 2003 Guitar World article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the
                        album's release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross
                        argued that In Utero was "a far better record [than Nevermind] and one that only 10 years
                        later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for
                        an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or
                        underappreciated, then In Utero is that lost pearl." That same year, Pitchfork Media placed
                        In Utero at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked
                        it at number 439 on its list "The 500 Greatest
                        Albums of All Time". In 2004 Blender ranked it at number 94 in its "100 Greatest
                        American Albums of All Time" list, while in 2005, Spin placed it at number 51 on its "100
                        Greatest Albums 1985-2005" retrospective. In Utero has
                        been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for
                        shipments of over five million units, and has sold a total of four million copies in the United
                        States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. &lt;a

					<content>MTV Unplugged in New York is a live album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It features
                        an acoustic performance taped at Sony Music Studios in New York City on November 18, 1993 for
                        the television series MTV Unplugged. The show was
                        directed by Beth McCarthy and first aired on the cable television network MTV on December 14,
                        1993. As opposed to traditional practice on the television series, Nirvana played mainly
                        lesser-known material and cover versions of songs by The Vaselines,
                        David Bowie, Meat Puppets (during which they were joined by members of the group onstage) and
                        Leadbelly.

MTV Unplugged in New York was the first Nirvana album released in the wake
                        of the April 1994 death of singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain. The
                        album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the most successful posthumous
                        Nirvana release, selling five million copies in America by 1997.[citation needed] It was hailed
                        by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the
                        grunge sound they were commonly associated with.[1] MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs
                        which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: "Something in the
                        Way" and "Oh, Me." The album won a Grammy
                        Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996. The performance received a DVD release in 2007.

					<content>Nevermind is the second studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on
                        September 24, 1991. Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the group's first release on
                        Geffen Records, which signaled its move away from Seattle-based
                        independent record label Sub Pop. Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the
                        restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the
                        Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics.

Nevermind
                        was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single "Smells
                        Like Teen Spirit". By January 1992 it had replaced Michael Jackson's album Dangerous
                        at number one on the Billboard charts. Nevermind was
                        responsible for bringing alternative rock to a large mainstream audience, and would subsequently
                        be regarded as one of the best rock albums of all time.

Nirvana was a band from
                        Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic,
                        that had signed to Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. The group released its debut album
                        Bleach in 1989, with Chad Channing on drums. However, Channing left Nirvana in 1990, and the
                        band was in need of a permanent drummer. Upon seeing a show
                        by hardcore punk band Scream, the group's drummer, Dave Grohl, impressed Novoselic and
                        Cobain. When Scream unexpectedly disbanded, Grohl contacted Novoselic, made his way to Seattle,
                        and was soon invited to join the band. Novoselic said in
                        retrospect that when Grohl joined the band, everything "fell into place".

Meanwhile
                        Cobain was writing a number of new songs. At the time Cobain was listening to bands like R.E.M.,
                        The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling
                        disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene which Sub Pop had
                        built its image upon, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs
                        that were more melodic. A key development was the single
                        "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain
                        said "was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single
                        to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more
                        songs like that." Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening
                        their music to children's music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as
                        possible.

By the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was
                        experiencing financial difficulties. With rumors that Sub Pop would sign up as a subsidiary for
                        a major label, the band decided to "cut out the middleman" and start to look for a
                        major label. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana
                        ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon the recommendation of its
                        management, who also managed the band's idols (and recent Geffen signings) Sonic Youth, and
                        Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon.

In the spring of
                        1990, Nirvana began planning its second album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the
                        album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig as a potential producer. Nirvana
                        particularly liked Vig's work with Killdozer and called Vig up to
                        tell him, "We want to sound as heavy as that record." In April 1990, the band traveled
                        out to Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to begin work on the album. Most of the
                        basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but
                        Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately,
                        eight songs were recorded: "Immodium" (later renamed "Breed"), "Dive"
                        (later released as the B-side to "Sliver"),
                        "In Bloom", "Pay to Play" (eventually renamed "Stay Away" and
                        given a new set of lyrics), "Sappy", "Lithium", "Here She Comes Now"
                        (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and
                        Hell Volume 1), and "Polly". The band had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain
                        blew his voice out on "Lithium", forcing them to shut down recording. Vig was told
                        that the band would come back to record more songs, but the
                        producer did not hear anything for a while. Instead, the band used the sessions as a demo tape
                        to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels,
                        creating a buzz around the group.

After signing to
                        Geffen, a number of producers for the album were suggested, including Scott Litt, David Briggs,
                        and Don Dixon, but Nirvana held out for Vig. Novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already
                        nervous about recording on a major label, since the
                        producers suggested wanted percentage points for the album, and they optioned for Vig, with whom
                        they felt comfortable collaborating. Afforded a budget of $65,000, Nirvana recorded Nevermind at
                        Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, California in May and
                        June 1991. Nirvana was originally set to record the album during March and April 1991, but the
                        date kept getting pushed back in spite of the band's anxiousness to begin the sessions. To
                        pay gas money to get to Los Angeles, Nirvana played a show
                        where they played "Smells Like Teen Spirit" for the first time. The band sent Vig some
                        rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at Smart Studios,
                        along with some new ones including "Smells Like Teen
                        Spirit" and "Come as You Are".

When the group arrived in California,
                        Nirvana did a few days of pre-production where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song
                        arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart
                        Studios sessions was the song "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad
                        Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members
                        tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes;
                        if the takes weren't satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The
                        group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were
                        needed. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum
                        tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and
                        particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's
                        phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix
                        the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording
                        additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In
                        particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on
                        the song "In Bloom" by telling him "John Lennon did it." While the sessions
                        went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: "He'd
                        be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner
                        and say nothing for an hour."

After the recording sessions were completed, Vig and
                        the band set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members
                        realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were
                        turning out. As a result, they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing, with
                        Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several
                        familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with
                        R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that
                        bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands.
                        Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced
                        Slayer's 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) from the bottom of the list. Novoselic recalled,
                        "We said, 'right on,' because those Slayer records were so heavy." Wallace
                        ran the songs through various special effects boxes and
                        tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years
                        later that upon hearing Wallace's work the band loved the mixes. After the album's
                        release members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the
                        polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, "Looking back
                        on the production of Nevermind, I'm embarrassed by it now. It's closer to a Mötley
                        Crüe record than it is a punk rock
                        record."

Nevermind was mastered on the afternoon of August 2 in The Mastering Lab
                        in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the
                        appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy
                        Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs
                        mastered at the session, a hidden track called "Endless, Nameless" intended to appear
                        at the end of "Something in the Way", was
                        accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, "In the beginning,
                        it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their
                        instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I
                        didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they
                        pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there."
                        When the band discovered the song's omission after
                        listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake.
                        Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of "Something in
                        the Way" and the start of the hidden track on future
                        pressings of the album.

Nevermind was released on September 24, 1991. American record
                        stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies, while 35,000 copies were shipped in the
                        United Kingdom, where Bleach had been successful. The lead
                        single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" had been released on September 10 with the intention
                        of being a base-building cut among alternative rock fans, while the next single "Come As
                        You Are" would be the song that would possibly garner
                        more attention. The band set out on a short American tour four days before the release date to
                        support the album. Geffen Records hoped that Nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies, which
                        was the same level the record company had achieved with
                        Sonic Youth's Geffen debut Goo. The best estimate was that if all involved worked hard, the
                        record could possibly be certified Gold by September 1992.

The album debuted on the
                        Billboard 200 at position 144, which was high enough for the
                        album to top the Heatseekers chart as well. Geffen shipped about half of the initial US pressing
                        to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen
                        reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order
                        to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few
                        months, the momentum increased significantly as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" unexpectedly
                        became more and more popular. The song's video had
                        received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon
                        proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon
                        certified gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the
                        achievement. Novoselic recalled, "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was
                        kind of neat. But I don't give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It's
                        cool—I guess."

As the band set out for their
                        European tour at the start of November 1991, Nevermind entered the Billboard Top 40 for the
                        first time at number 35. By this point, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" had become a genuine
                        hit and the album was selling so fast none of Geffen's
                        marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted. Geffen president Ed
                        Rosenblatt told The New York Times, "We didn't do anything. It was just one of those
                        'Get out of the way and duck' records." Nirvana
                        found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold,
                        television crews became a constant presence onstage, and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was
                        almost omnipresent on radio and music
                        television.

Nevermind became Nirvana's first number one album on January 11, 1992,
                        replacing Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard charts. By this time, Nevermind was
                        selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. "Come As You
                        Are" was finally released as the second single in March 1992; it peaked at number 32 on the
                        Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Two more singles, "Lithium" and "In Bloom",
                        were released from the album.

Nevermind was
                        certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1991,
                        and was certified Diamond in March 1999. It was also certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000
                        units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in March
                        2001. In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released Nevermind on vinyl as part of its ANADISQ 200
                        series, and as a 24-carat gold CD. The CD pressings included "Endless, Nameless". The
                        LP version sold out quickly of its limited pressing, but
                        the CD edition stayed in print.

Upon the album's release, several mainstream
                        newspapers and magazines gave Nevermind positive reviews. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times
                        wrote, "With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly
                        succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and
                        inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." Schoemer concluded, "'Nevermind'
                        is more sophisticated and carefully produced
                        than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." Entertainment
                        Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind Nirvana
                        "never entertain the notion" of wanting to sound
                        "normal," compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very
                        enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that "When Nirvana
                        released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us
                        figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away. My
                        God have they proved us right."

Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five
                        stars; reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, "If Nirvana isn't
                        onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit
                        to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits." The Boston
                        Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve
                        Morse wrote, "Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by
                        countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers," and added "the band has
                        little or nothing to say, settling for moronic ramblings by
                        singer-lyricist Cobain."

Nevermind was voted as the best album of the year in The
                        Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll; "Smells Like Teen Spirit" also topped
                        the single of the year and video of the year polls.
                        Nevermind topped the poll by a large majority, and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote
                        in his companion piece to the poll, "As a modest pop surprise they might have scored a
                        modest victory, like De La Soul in 1990. Instead, their
                        multi-platinum takeover constituted the first full-scale public validation of the Amerindie
                        values—the noise, the toons, the 'tude—the radder half of the Pazz &amp; Jop poll
                        electorate came up on."

Cobain, Nirvana's main
                        songwriter, fashioned chord sequences that were based mainly around power chords and wrote songs
                        that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar rhythms. His aim for Nevermind's material was
                        to sound like the "Bay City Rollers getting
                        molested by Black Flag". Many of the songs on Nevermind feature shifts in dynamics, where
                        the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses. Dave Grohl said this approach originated
                        during a four-month period prior to the recording of the
                        album, where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions.

Guitar
                        World wrote, "Kurt Cobain's guitar sound on Nirvana's Nevermind set the tone for
                        Nineties rock music." On Nevermind, Cobain
                        played a 1960s Fender Mustang, a Fender Jaguar with DiMarzio pickups, and a few Fender
                        Stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups. The guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as
                        his main effects, the latter used to generate a "watery"
                        sound on "Come as You Are" and the pre-choruses of "Smells Like Teen Spirit".
                        Krist Novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to D flat "to get this
                        fat-ass sound".

Grohl said that Cobain told
                        him, "Music comes first, lyrics come second," and Grohl believes that above all Cobain
                        focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well
                        into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally,
                        Cobain's phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand. Vig asserted that clarity
                        of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, "Even though you couldn't quite
                        tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as
                        hell." Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing
                        and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing "Why in the hell do journalists insist on
                        coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics,
                        when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?"

Charles R.
                        Cross asserted in his 2001 biography of Kurt Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, that many of the songs
                        written for Nevermind were about Cobain's
                        dysfunctional relationship with Tobi Vail. After the relationship ended, Cobain began writing
                        and painting violent scenes, many of which revealed hatred for himself and others. Songs written
                        during this period were less violent, but still reflected
                        anger absent from Cobain's earlier songs. Cross wrote "In the four months following
                        their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs, all of them about
                        Tobi Vail". "Drain You" begins with the line
                        "One baby to another said 'I'm lucky to have met you'", quoting what
                        Vail had once told Cobain, and the line "It is now my duty to completely drain you"
                        refers to the power Vail had over Kurt in their relationship.
                        According to Novoselic, "'Lounge Act' is about Tobi", and the song contains
                        the line "I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield", referring to Cobain
                        having the K Records logo tattooed on his arm to impress Vail.
                        Though "Lithium" had been written before Cobain knew Vail, the lyrics of the song were
                        changed to reference her. Cobain also said in an interview with Musician that "some of my
                        very personal experiences, like breaking up with
                        girlfriends and having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in the song is
                        feeling–very lonely, sick."

The album's tentative title Sheep was something
                        Cobain created as an inside joke towards the people he
                        expected to buy the record. He wrote a fake ad for Sheep in his journal that read "Because
                        you want to not; because everyone else is." Novoselic said the inspiration for the title
                        was the band's cynicism about the public's
                        reaction to Operation Desert Storm. As recording sessions for the album were completed, Cobain
                        grew tired of the title and suggested to Novoselic that the new album be named Nevermind. Cobain
                        liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude
                        on life, and because it was grammatically incorrect.

The Nevermind album cover shows a
                        baby swimming toward a US dollar bill on a fishhook. According to Cobain, he conceived the idea
                        while watching a television program on water births with
                        Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock
                        footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Also, the stock
                        house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that
                        they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use, so instead Fisher sent a
                        photographer to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on
                        the image of a three-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son
                        of the photographer's friend Rick Elden. However, there was some concern because Elden's
                        penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they
                        were afraid that it would offend people, but relented
                        when Cobain made it clear that the only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the
                        penis that would say, "If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile."

The
                        back cover of the album features a
                        photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features
                        photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante's Inferno, and
                        pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain's collection of
                        medical photos. Cobain noted, "If you look real close, there is a picture of Kiss in the
                        back standing on a slab of beef." The album's liner notes contain no complete song
                        lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and
                        unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem.

Nevermind not only
                        popularized the Seattle grunge movement, but also brought alternative rock as a whole into the
                        mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability.
                        Nevermind's success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its
                        impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: "It was like our record could have
                        been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had.
                        It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of
                        what they did". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that in the aftermath
                        of the album's breakthrough, "Suddenly, all bets
                        are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery,
                        obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company
                        executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and
                        previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the
                        opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.

Michael Azerrad argued in his
                        Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana (1993)
                        that Nevermind marked the emergence of a generation of music fans in their twenties in a climate
                        dominated by the musical tastes of the baby boomer generation that preceded them. Azerrad wrote,
                        "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time.
                        This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked,
                        ignored, or condescended to." Rolling Stone wrote in its entry for Nevermind on its 2003
                        list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "No album in
                        recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned
                        punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator."

Nevermind has continued
                        to garner critical praise since its release. The album
                        was listed at number seventeen on Rolling Stone's list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All
                        Time". Time placed Nevermind, which writer Josh Tyrangiel called "the finest album of
                        the 90s," on its 2006 list of "The All-TIME 100
                        Albums." Pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade, noting that "anyone
                        who hates this record today is just trying to be cool, and needs to be trying harder." In
                        2005, the Library of Congress added Nevermind to the
                        National Recording Registry, which collects "culturally, historically or aesthetically
                        important" sound recordings from the 20th century. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind"&gt;Read

				<content>There are multiple artists tracked as "Nirvana" on Last.fm. Following are six, listed in order of prominence:

1) Nirvana was a popular and highly influential American grunge band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in
        1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television
        during the early-to-mid '90s.

In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987–1988).The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape. After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead
        practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of "Love Buzz", a song by Dutch group 'Shocking Blue', was released in November 1988 on the
        Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, 'Bleach', was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the 'Blew EP' with producer Steve Fisk.

At the start of the
        new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, 'Nevermind', would eventually sell over seven
        million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide.

In early 1993, Nirvana released "Puss"/"Oh, the Guilt", a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch &amp; Go. Meanwhile, the
        group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. 'In Utero' debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. 

As Nirvana's frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the
        media as the "spokesman of a generation", with Nirvana the "flagship band" of "Generation X", their third studio album 'In Utero' was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While
        Nirvana's mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had
        always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.

Nirvana's brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded
        in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, "You Know You're Right", an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut,
        the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.

In 2004, the box set "With the Lights
        Out", a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, "Sliver: The Best Of The Box" was released, a compilation of selected "WTLO" tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a
        track from the famous "Fecal Matter" demo.

Band members: Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)

Prior members:Aaron Burckhard - drums
        (1987–1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990), Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990)

Touring members: Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994), Lori Goldston - cello
        (1993–1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994)

2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.

The band
        was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick
        Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably "Rainbow Chaser", "Pentecost Hotel", and "Tiny Goddess") for the fledgling Island Records label.

The band was signed by Island
        Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. 

In October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was
        probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who's Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks' Arthur (September
        1969).

Musically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.

The next year 1968
        their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969.

In 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary
        contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might
        Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.

The band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional
        title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song
        "Lithium" originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the
        original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.

In 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled "Chemistry" including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.

Top
        musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth.

The group
        was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of "Rubber Soul" and "Revolver", The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the
        Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana's albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music
        - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of "progressive rock, soft rock or "orchestral pop".

Their first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received
        critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.

As of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and
        recording.

                        Preceded by a string of low-profile buzz single releases throughout 2010, the identity behind
                        The Weeknd was kept secret from the public which attracted significant interest. House of
                        Balloons received the 'Best New Music' title at
                        Pitchfork.com. Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating based on reviews by industry
                        professionals, gave House of Balloons a rating of 87 based on 16 reviews indicating 'Universal
                        Acclaim,' also making it the third highest scoring
                        R&amp;B release ever. In December of 2011, Metacritic determined that House of Balloons was the
                        third best-reviewed project of the year. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd/House+of+Balloons"&gt;Read

				<content>The Weeknd, the stage name for Abel Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer.
The Scarborough, Toronto-born singer, songwriter, and producer doesn't say much outside of his lyrics or personal messages through his social
        networking sites. Ever since appearing on the scene in late 2010, he's been shrouded in mystery, cultivating a mystique that baffles our gossip-obsessed pop culture. With that said, the 27-year-old alternative R&amp;B phenomenon is an enigma in
        more ways than one.

For him, it's not about becoming famous. It's not about becoming rich. It's not about pleasing anyone. It's about being honest, staying true to his art, and diving headfirst into the deep end.
        History's most impactful artists from Van Gogh and Charles Bukowski to Miles Davis and John Lennon faced both the abyss and the heavens. They knew about sex, drugs, pain, joy, and love, and they weren't afraid to talk about them
        openly.

On his three-disc debut for XO/Republic Records, Trilogy, The Weeknd is an open book, revealing
everything and nothing at the same time. There are moments of ecstatic electronic bliss like the irresistible "High for
        This", and then there's the propulsive poetic paranoia of "House of Balloons", which twists a sample Siouxsie and the Banshees' Happy House into a frenetic danceable coup. With an inimitable and divine voice, he sings of hazy
        nights that turned into hazier mornings and tumultuous trysts that spiraled into eternal longing. However, you can take whatever you want from it. After all, it is art.

His trip officially began with the release of the nine-song free album
        House of Balloons in March 2011. It was the first in a series of three-including Thursday and Echoes of Silence-and it immediately set the blog-o-sphere ablaze. Soon after the initial instalment impacted the net, Drake quoted lyrics from the effort
        on Twitter and linked to the music, becoming the first of many A-list artists to champion it. The two quickly forged a tight friendship and fertile artistic partnership that extended to Drake's team.

As they grew closer, the superstar
        MC even enlisted his talents for several tracks on the chart-topping, platinum-selling and Grammy Award winning album Take Care. Most notably, The Weeknd co-wrote, co-produced, and performed on "Crew Love", a bona fide hit single from the
        record. Further collaborating, Drake dropped a transfixing verse on "The Zone" from Thursday.

The artist hit the road for his first sold out headline tour that summer, and the world began to embrace him with open arms from
        underground bloggers to taste-making music supervisors. "High for This" even served as the soundtrack to the trailer for the final season of HBO's long-running series, Entourage, a symbol of his infiltration into the
        zeitgeist.

Meanwhile, critics and gatekeepers also fell under his spell. Complex dubbed House of Balloons the "best album of 2011", and Pitchfork honored it as "Best New Music". It conquered year-end lists, including
        Stereogum, The A.V. Club, The Guardian (UK), and Spin. MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL, and others exalted it with equally high praise, while The Source called him the "Songbird of his generation".

In the midst of everything, other
        marquee artists began to personally seek out his unique talent, and that was the highest compliment. He created the first formal remix for FLORENCE + THE MACHINE's "Shake It Out", and he put his stamp on LADY GAGA's "Marry
        the Night", yielding a seductive and sensual take on the single for Born This Way: The Remixes. The Weeknd also personally cooked up "Remember You" the second single for WIZ KHALIFA's anxiously awaited sophomore effort,
        O.N.I.F.C.

In the summer of 2012, a groundbreaking strategic alliance between XO, creative collective visionary behind The Weeknd and Republic Records was established. Under this banner, Trilogy compiled House of Balloons, Thursday, and
        Echoes of Silence in one expansive collection, properly mixed, mastered, and
finished for the very first time. The 27 original tracks remain, but there's also a myriad of new material as well to please both the initiated and uninitiated
        alike. The doorway officially opens into his world with this effort.

The first single "Wicked Games" bleeds brilliantly with a stark and vivid admission that's utterly enthralling. Keyboards resound through airy production as
        the vocals exude a dark sensuality. The singer admits, "I love to watch you dance, take you down another level and get you dancing with the devil", before the unforgettable, unbridled hook, "Let me motherfucking love
        you".

You're going to motherfucking love him. Live audiences continue to as well. In addition to surprise appearances on DRAKE's Club Paradise tour and a stint supporting FLORENCE + THE MACHINE, he dazzled crowds at the
        biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, and the Wireless Festival in London and on a seemingly endless run of sold out headline gigs. The next chapter has begun though.

Coming together, Republic Records
        and the Canadian XO are paving the way for a revolution. Already, XO has progressed from an intimate Toronto operation into an international player. Everything stems from the music though, and it always will. THE WEEKND addressed fans in an open
        letter online, "You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I
        love to do and that is to entertain you." He released his second album, "Kiss Land", on September 10, 2013.

(2) Allegedly "shrouded in mystery" despite a social media presence (with accompanying photos) on Twitter,
        Tumblr, Facebook, Soundcloud, and YouTube, as well as major support from fellow Torontonian Drake, alternative R&amp;B act the Weeknd -- a solo outlet for vocalist Abel Tesfaye -- surfaced in March 2011 with House of Balloons. A nine-track, 50-minute
        mixtape made available for free download on the Weeknd website, House of Balloons was based in morose ballads filled with drug references and sexual longing. Sonically, there were clear traces of radio-friendly contemporary R&amp;B à la Trey Songz,
        Jeremih, the-Dream, and Drake, while also appealing to listeners who favored left-of-center, production-over-songcraft exponents like Spacek and Sa-Ra. The mixtape, made by Tesfaye in collaboration with producers Doc McKinney and Illangelo, among
        others, garnered widespread coverage -- most of which was gushingly positive -- within days of its March 21 release. A second mixtape, Thursday (August 19), preceded several appearances on Drake's album Take Care. Echoes of Silence (December
        21), the third Weeknd mixtape, followed just before the end of the year. The following June, "Crew Love," off Take Care, reached the Top Ten of Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. A few months later, he was featured on another
        charting single, Wiz Khalifa's "Remember You." 

 After Tesfaye signed with Universal Republic, the three Weeknd mixtapes were remastered and bundled with three new songs for Trilogy, issued in November 2012. The set debuted at
        number four on the Billboard 200 chart. The following April, Tesfaye won Juno Awards in the categories of Breakthrough Artist of the Year and R&amp;B/Soul Recording of the Year. Trilogy was certified platinum by the RIAA the next month. Kiss Land,
        much darker in tone than its title implied, followed in September 2013 and debuted at number two. Out of its several singles, only "Live For," featuring Drake, touched the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. Tesfaye had much more success with a
        series of non-album singles that followed. "Often," released in 2014, was a Top Ten R&amp;B/Hip-Hop hit. He was featured on Ariana Grande's "Love Me Harder," which reached the Top Ten of the Hot 100 and went platinum in the
        U.S. "Earned It," featured in Fifty Shades of Grey, repeated the same feats. In 2015, Tesfaye issued "The Hills," a booming ballad, and "Can't Feel My Face," a disco-funk throwback, as the first two singles from
        Chapter III. The former cracked the Hot 100 Top 20, while the latter reached the chart's Top 10. ~ Andy Kellman &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available

                        released on 19 November 2007 in the UK and on 20 November in the
                        United States and is available in standard and deluxe editions.The standard Japanese edition
                        features two extra tracks while the Japanese deluxe version has no extra tracks. The creature on
                        the album cover is Pazuzu.

D-Sides performed
                        similarly to its 2002 predecessor, G-Sides, reaching #63 on the UK Album Chart, while it only
                        managed #166 on the US Billboard 200 chart.


 


Background
In a
                        2006 interview with Verbicide magazine, band members were
                        asked if a new remix album would be produced for Demon Days as there was for Gorillaz. They
                        answered that it was a possibility and that might involve the Space Monkeyz again. In the same
                        interview, they were asked if there might also be another
                        G-Sides. Again, their answer was that it might be possible. In January 2007, websites began
                        listing a March release date for a Phase 2 B-sides album. One of the websites, musictap.net,
                        later pushed this back to 3 April. According to
                        Gorillaz-Unofficial, the reaction of official parties behind Gorillaz is that the release date
                        is just a rumour for now. On 29 August, musictap.net reported that the B-side album would be
                        titled D-Sides and would be released on 20 November. On 18
                        September 2007, the official Gorillaz fansite confirmed the release of the album, as well as
                        unveiling the album artwork and track listing. D-Sides was released on 19 November 2007 in the
                        UK and on 20 November 2007 in the U.S.

					<content>Demon Days is the second studio album and a concept album by Gorillaz, released on 23 May
                        2005 in the United Kingdom and on 24 May in the United States. The album features contributions

                        London Community Gospel Choir and the San Fernando Valley Youth Chorus.

Demon Days
                        entered the UK charts at #1 and the U.S. charts at #6,
                        outperforming the band's 2001 debut, Gorillaz. The album had sold over six million copies
                        as of 2006. The album features the singles "Feel Good Inc.", "DARE", "Dirty
                        Harry" and "Kids with Guns" / "El
                        Mañana".



Album information
Demon Days was first mentioned in
                        articles detailing the reopening of Gorillaz' website in early December 2004. Initially, a
                        March or April 2005 release date was announced, but it was later
                        pushed back. In an article for Q magazine in February 2005 it was reported that the album was to
                        be titled We Are Happy Landfill. Another early title was reported to be Reject False Icons,
                        which is also the title of Gorillaz' culture jamming
                        project.

In January 2005 a promo for the song "Dirty Harry" was released as a
                        white label 12" and an exclusive video was released online entitled "Rock It". It
                        was later reported that the track would not appear on
                        the album, although it later appeared on D-Sides, a collection of remixes, rare songs and
                        B-sides released in November 2007.

Demon Days' lead single "Feel Good Inc."
                        became Gorillaz' biggest hit (UK #2, US #14, US-Modern
                        Rock #1) at the time. The album's second single, "DARE" featuring Shaun Ryder,
                        became a big hit as well, giving the band their first #1 single in the UK. Since its release,
                        Demon Days has been certified double platinum in the U.S. and
                        5 times platinum in the UK.

The album cover is a reference to Let It Be by The Beatles
                        and resembles the Blur: The Best Of artwork, the greatest hits album by Albarn's first band
                        Blur.

This album has been released with the Copy
                        Control protection system in some regions.

A limited edition of the album was released
                        in a special digipak gatefold, allowing the owner to choose which band member is on the cover.
                        It also contains an exclusive booklet, with lyrics and
                        illustrations for each song, a DVD containing the video (with audio commentary), an animatic for
                        the music video "Feel Good Inc.", short animated films featuring the band, an
                        exclusive audio track titled "The Swagga" and online
                        access to exclusive sections of the band's website, with various wallpapers and
                        screensavers, as well as a crowbar, facilitating the opening of a locked cupboard in the kitchen
                        on Gorillaz.com in order to download the song "Happy
                        Landfill".


 Marketing

 Reject False Icons
The phrase 'Reject
                        False Icons' was first mentioned on 24 November 2004 on a Gorillaz mail out to fans. On 8
                        December, the Gorillaz website was re-opened with a brand
                        new music video, "Rock It", which has the saying "Reject False Icons" at the
                        end. On 19 December the 'Reject False Icons' campaign kicked off with the launch of
                        rejectfalseicons.com. Fans could submit their photos of
                        ways to spread the message by using graffiti or by sticking 'Reject False Icons'
                        stickers that were available for a limited period from the site and from selected record shops
                        in the UK. It was first Respect False Icons, but Albarn changed
                        it to Reject False Icons. Noodle said it is both 'Respect' and 'Reject'.


Search
                        for a Star
In December 2004, the Gorillaz launched their own talent contest, Search for a
                        Star, to find an artist to collaborate
                        with.[7] There were on average over 100 entries per week whittled down to around 10 to be put
                        forward for the public vote. The 200+ entries were viewed over a million times. A gallery room
                        was added to Kong Studios which displayed all of the entries.
                        Originally, Gorillaz' competition, was initially run to pick just one winner from entries
                        submitted to Gorillaz.com. However, at the end of the competition, it was announced that two
                        further entries—one from the submitted images, and one from
                        the submitted audio files—would be chosen by online vote.

The winners for each entries
                        are as followed:

All three collaborated on the fourth single release of Phase
                        Two, "Kids With Guns" / "El
                        Mañana". Sourbee provided his animated incarnation of the "Don't Get Lost In
                        Heaven (Original Demo Version)" B-side, featured on the DVD version of the single. Asidus
                        made a "Dirty Harry" remix called "Uno

                        interpretation of "El Mañana", featured on an insert included on the DVD version of
                        the single.


Reception
Spin (p.64) - Ranked #4 in
                        Spin's "40 Best Albums Of 2005" - "[A] vivid, spastic concept album about
                        the last primates to survive the apocalypse" - 
Spin (p.105) - "Albarn still has
                        great taste in other people's music. His new accomplice,
                        copyright pirate Danger Mouse, fills in suggestively dubby spaces with choirs, staggering
                        synths, and MCs ranging from De La Soul to Roots Manuva to MF Doom." - Grade: B 
Entertainment
                        Weekly (No. 821/822, p.136) - "[This] follow-up is
                        spookier, blippier, and more on edge." - Grade: B 
Uncut (p.106) – 4 stars out of 5 -
                        "Dazzlingly clever - great beats, brilliant production, top tunes and some of Albarn's
                        best singing." 
CMJ (No. 914, p.4) - "...an
                        immensely absorbable experience with plenty of rhymes and funked-out marching beats to bite
                        into." 
Vibe (p.143) - "[A]s original - and just as much fun - as the first."
                        
Mojo (p.18) - Ranked #18 in Mojo's "The 50
                        Best Albums Of 2005" - "[A] genre-busting, contemporary pop milestone."

					<summary>Gorillaz is the eponymous debut album by Gorillaz, released in March 2001. It includes the
                        singles "Clint Eastwood", "19-2000", "Rock the House" and "Tomorrow
                        Comes Today". The album reached #3 in the
                        UK, and was an unexpected hit in the U.S., hitting #14 and selling over seven million copies

In an introduction to the

					<content>Plastic Beach is the third studio album by English virtual band Gorillaz, released 3 March
                        2010 on Parlophone and Virgin Records. Conceived from an unfinished Gorillaz project called
                        Carousel, the album was recorded during June 2008 to
                        November 2009 and produced primarily by group co-creator Damon Albarn. It features guest
                        appearances by several artists, including Snoop Dogg, Gruff Rhys, Bobby Womack, Mos Def, Lou
                        Reed, Mick Jones, and the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble. Primarily a pop
                        album, Plastic Beach contains lyrics concerning consumerism and ecology-related themes.

The
                        album has produced three singles, "Stylo", "Superfast Jellyfish", and "On
                        Melancholy Hill".

Creators of
                        Gorillaz, musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett, began working on a new Gorillaz
                        project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's
                        third studio album. In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked
                        what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied "Well, I'm doing the next
                        Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz." In the February 2008
                        Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying
                        "I think the idea behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their movies –
                        Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though
                        none of the members of the band were in the movies. I don't
                        think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's
                        the principle." In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, "Gorillaz now
                        to us is not like four animated characters any
                        more — it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects. [...] That's my
                        ideal model — Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and now want to give you new
                        stuff."

In the Observer interview, Hewlett said
                        that there is "a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which
                        is even bigger and more difficult than Monkey, and it isn't going to fit anywhere and no
                        one's going to like it, ha ha ha! We've started
                        work — I've done a lot of visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't
                        figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's
                        sort of like a film, but not with one narrative
                        story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live
                        action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's
                        a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look,
                        it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for
                        a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or
                        even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70
                        songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's
                        still just a really good idea." Carousel was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain.

				<summary>Gorillaz are a British virtual band formed in 1998 by Damon Albarn of Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to
        call the project Gorilla.

The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not
        alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>
				<content>Gorillaz are a British virtual band formed in 1998 by Damon Albarn of Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to
        call the project Gorilla.

The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not
        alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The
        Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and
        electronica.

They have released five studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010), The Fall (Also in 2010) and Humanz (2017). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides
        (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown, Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House, and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades. At the end of 2010,
        Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US 'Escape to Plastic Beach' tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website.

The
        band's first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the
        House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the
        Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band's request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken as a band-member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking
        Heads.and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator.

At the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single was from the
        soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company.

Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May 2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc., DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Mañana. Demon Days went five times
        platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album (produced by Dj Danger Mouse) include De La Soul, Bootie
        Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, and Roots Manuva, amongst others.

In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the
        band's third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, "I'm making this one the most pop record I've ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that
        has got depth.” The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The
        Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. 

A 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections.
        Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 &amp; 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 &amp; 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were
        behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars).

Since the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have
        been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said "Ultimately we didn't think that feel we're in a position to make the kind of movie we
        want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. [...] But I'd still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday."

Albarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West, which premiered in the summer
        of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris
        in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008.

The duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the
        Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom's coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a "Journey to the East", with the characters
        finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. 

Gorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival.

At the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next
        album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It is the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website and was available for free download for a limited time.

In April 2012, Albarn told The
        Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were "unlikely".

Gorillaz's current live band's lineup includes 
Damon Albarn - Vocals, keyboards, guitar, bass guitar 
Jamie Hewlett -

					<content>Thank Me Later is the debut studio album of Canadian rapper Drake, released June 15, 2010

                        featured contributions from Timbaland, Swizz Beatz, and Kanye West, among others. Thank Me Later
                        features a predominantly sparse, downbeat production and
                        contains subjective lyrics concerning themes of fame, self-examination, and love.

The
                        album received generally positive reviews from most music critics, earning praise for Drake's
                        introspective lyrics and receiving musical comparisons
                        to the works of hip hop artists Kanye West and Kid Cudi. Following an anticipated release, it
                        debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 447,000 copies in the United States
                        in its first week. It reached platinum certification in
                        Canada within its debut week and produced three singles that attained chart success. The album
                        has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, with shipments of
                        one million copies in the United States. &lt;a

				<content>Aubrey “Drake” Graham (born October 24, 1986 in Toronto, Ontario) is a Grammy award nominated Canadian actor, rapper and singer signed to Young Money/Universal Motown. Drake shot to global fame upon the release of his critically acclaimed
        2009 mixtape So Far Gone and Best I Ever Had, a single from the mixtape which peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Drake's music career began in 2006 with the release of his debut mixtape room for improvement. The tape featured
        collaborations with Trey Songz, Lupe Fiasco and Nikelus F and marked the beginning of a long-time partnership with Canadian producer boi-1da. The mixtape sold 6,000 physical copies in the year of its release.

comeback season, Drake's
        second official mixtape, was released in 2007 and featured the single replacement girl. The track featured vocals from Trey Songz and received heavy rotation on MTV and BET television networks. robin thicke, clipse and rich boy featured on the
        mixtape, however it was Man of the Year - a track recorded with future mentor lil wayne - which signified the start of a close affiliation between Drake and Lil' Wayne's recording label Young Money Entertainment.

In 2009, Drake
        released his highly anticipated third mixtape so far gone to critical acclaim and commercial success. Its lead single, Best I Ever Had, peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA. The success of the
        track lead to a highly publicised bidding war between several record labels to sign Drake. The rapper eventually signed a deal with Young Money Entertainment in the summer of 2009 and released an official EP version of the mixtape soon after;
        eventually receiving Gold status for shipments of 500,000 units.

This astronomical rise to success continued into 2010 with the release of his major label debut album thank me later. After several setbacks from its original October 2009
        release date, the album was released on June 15th 2010 preceded by lead single over, which peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at #1 on the Hot Rap Songs chart. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard Album Chart and has since been certified
        Platinum by the RIAA for sales of approximately 1,100,000 copies in the US to date. It produced three further singles which attained chart success; Find Your Love, Miss Me (feat. Lil' Wayne) and fancy (feat. T.I. &amp; Swizz
        Beatz).

Drake released his second album 'Take Care' in November 2011 and it critically and commercially was very successful.The album spawned eight singles including the immensely popular The Motto which introduced the term
        'YOLO' to the mainstream. With features from Lil Wayne, Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Nicki Minaj and more the album went 2x platinum in the United States and in Canada, but only managing gold in the United Kingdom.

In November 2013
        Drake released the highly anticipated 'Nothing Was The Same' which was also very critically and commercially succesful and has since spawned seven singles. Jay Z is the only other rapper to appear on the standard version of the album. Drake
        said about the album "Take Care was about connecting with my city and connecting with my past and sort of still feeling guilty that I'm not in love with one of these girls that cared about me from back in the day. Now, I'm 26, I'm
        with my friends, I'm making jobs for people, I'm making memories for people that will last a lifetime. I don't need to be in love right now. I don't need these things that I maybe once thought that I needed to feel normal and feel
        righteous about myself. I think for the first time in an album I'm content—not satisfied—but proud of where I'm at as a person."

Drake announced in July 2014 that his next album would be titled 'Views from the 6',
        though no release date has been given. However, in February 2015, with no prior announcement, Drake released 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' on iTunes. This marked Drake's fourth retail release with his record label
        Cash Money Records. Despite stating the release as a mix-tape it was made available for purchase on iTunes. As of August 2015, 'If You're Reading This It's Too Late' has sold over 1 million copies. Drake is the first artist to
        pass the Platinum album status in 2015.

Drake released his fourth album, Views, in 2016, breaking numerous chart records in the process. Views sat atop the Billboard 200 for ten nonconsecutive weeks, becoming the first album by a solo male
        to do so in over 10 years. It also saw Drake leading the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard 200 simultaneously for eight weeks, breaking the previous record of seven held by both Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston. It also achieved triple platinum
        status in the U.S., and earned over 1 million album-equivalent units in the first week of its release. One of the tracks, One Dance, became Drake's first #1 single on the Hot 100, spending ten weeks on top of the chart.

Drake released
        the multi-genre More Life in 2017. Described by Drake as a playlist, it was his seventh consecutive No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and set multiple streaming records. More Life received generally positive reviews and debuted at number one on the US
        Billboard 200, becoming his seventh consecutive number one album, while also breaking several streaming records. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drake"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the

					<content>Animals is an album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 23 January
                        1977 in the UK and on 2 February 1977 in the U.S.

Animals is a concept album, based on
                        the flaws of capitalism. Various castes in society are
                        represented as different types of animals (Dogs as the businessmen, sheep as the powerless
                        pawns, and pigs as the ruthless leaders). Although this album mainly attacks capitalism, several
                        components are similar to George Orwell's novel
                        "Animal Farm": In the book various animals (mainly pigs, sheep, dogs, etc.) represent
                        different roles assumed by individuals in a communist society.

While singer and
                        guitarist David Gilmour is only credited for the music of one
                        track, the epic "Dogs" (previously known as "You Gotta Be Crazy"), this song
                        and "Raving and Drooling", a Waters song which would later become "Sheep",
                        were created at the same time as "Shine On You Crazy
                        Diamond", and originally destined for Wish You Were Here. Their creation process was
                        similar to the method the band used during the late sixties and early seventies. They would
                        adapt and expand their compositions by performing them live, and
                        later in the studio find a more coherent form and concept for the whole album, with Waters
                        writing the lyrics. Animals was the last Pink Floyd album created in this way, as the subsequent
                        The Wall and The Final Cut, were primarily conceived by Waters
                        and worked out in the studio with some input from Gilmour. Although Rick Wright admittedly did
                        not contribute much compositionally, he had some influence on the arrangement of the songs,
                        including solo playing on "Dogs" and
                        "Sheep". As with "Welcome to the Machine" and "Wish You Were Here"
                        on Wish You Were Here, Waters wrote "Pigs on the Wing" and "Pigs (Three Different
                        Ones)" to tie together the other songs in the
                        album's concept. His dominance in the writing credits and the discrepancy with the actual
                        creation process is directly related to the increasing tensions within the band.[citation
                        needed].

The three core songs are bookended by a pair of
                        love songs written by Waters for his then-wife Caroline:[citation needed] "Pigs on the
                        Wing, Part 1" and "Pigs on the Wing, Part 2". Both are in stark contrast to the
                        misanthropic middle three songs, and suggest that companionship
                        can help us overcome our flaws – though the final lines suggest that the singer is or was once
                        one of the dogs. For the 8-track cartridge release, which looped, Parts 1 and 2 were linked by a
                        guitar bridge performed by Snowy White (subsequently
                        available on White's 1996 album "Goldtop: Groups &amp; Sessions"), and the 17:08
                        song "Dogs" was cut into two tracks.

The giant, helium-filled pig seen on the
                        cover was actually flown over Battersea Power Station for
                        the photo shoot (under the direction of Storm Thorgerson). On the first day of shooting, a
                        marksman was on hand in case the pig broke free. However, according to Thorgerson, this was
                        considered an "insurance problem", and he was not hired
                        for the second day of shooting. Ironically, on December 3, 1976, during the second day, a gust
                        of wind broke the pig free of its moorings. Because there was no one to shoot the pig down, it
                        sailed away into the morning sky. A passenger plane reported
                        seeing the pig, causing all the flights at London Heathrow Airport to be delayed[citation
                        needed]. A police helicopter was sent up to track the pig, but was forced to return after
                        following the pig to an altitude of 5,000 feet. A warning was sent out
                        to pilots that a giant, flying pink pig was loose in the area[citation needed]. The CAA lost
                        radar contact on the pig near Chatham in Kent, at a height of 18,000 feet and flying East. It
                        finally landed in a farmer's field, without much damage.
                        They then repaired the pig, and flew it up for a third time. The resulting pictures were not
                        deemed suitable on their own (as the clear, blue sky from day three was thought to be much less
                        evocative), and the final image was made as a composite of
                        the power station picture from day one and the pig from day three.

The album had custom
                        picture labels, using drummer Nick Mason's handwriting as a typeface, as did the lyrics on
                        the liner sleeve. Side one's label depicted a
                        fish-eye lens view of a dog and the English countryside. Side two's was similar, but
                        featured a pig and sheep instead of the dog.

Originally released on Columbia Records in
                        the U.S. and Harvest Records in the UK, Animals was then
                        remastered in 1992 for its inclusion on the Shine On box set. The remaster was subsequently
                        released on its own by EMI in 1994. In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the
                        United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Japan.
                        Animals was again re-released in April 2000 by Capitol Records in the US, and on the EMI label
                        in Japan, Canada, South America and Australia again using the 1992 Shine On remaster along with
                        the artwork from the 1994 EMI Europe reissue.

The
                        album proved a success in the United Kingdom, where it reached #2 in the era of punk music. It
                        was also a success in the U.S., reaching #3 on the Billboard album charts (#1 and #2 were Hotel
                        California by The Eagles, and the soundtrack to the Barbara
                        Streisand film A Star Is Born). However, it was on the American charts for only six months even
                        though it has continued to sell solidly, to the extent of its having gone quadruple platinum,
                        according to the RIAA.

In the UK, the British
                        Phonographic Industry awarded the album Gold (100,000 units) in 1977. It has yet to achieve
                        Platinum.

					<summary>Meddle is a classic Pink Floyd album recorded and released in 1971, which contains Echoes,
                        one of their longest compositions. A few tibits of information about this album: The song "Echoes"
                        was the entire side B of Meddle.
                        "Echoes" was also featured on the Pink Floyd feature length, crowd-less show video,
                        titled "Live at Pompeii" 

The lyrics of the song "One Of These Days"
                        has only one sentence and it was spoken as opposed to
                        being sung. That Line was : "One of these days I am going to cut you up into little pieces"

					<content>Meddle is a classic Pink Floyd album recorded and released in 1971, which contains Echoes,
                        one of their longest compositions. A few tibits of information about this album: The song "Echoes"
                        was the entire side B of Meddle.
                        "Echoes" was also featured on the Pink Floyd feature length, crowd-less show video,
                        titled "Live at Pompeii" 

The lyrics of the song "One Of These Days"
                        has only one sentence and it was spoken as opposed to
                        being sung. That Line was : "One of these days I am going to cut you up into little pieces"
                        .
The song "Seamus" was used as the opening credits music for the independent Film
                        "Rosencrantz And Guilenstern Are Dead",
                        starring Gary Oldman and Tim Roth. This fictional film was based on the 1970's play of the
                        same title.

In the song San Tropez, there is a reference to eating a peach on a sofa
                        and playing a particularly favorite guitar of Roger Waters,
                        a Gibson Country Style. 
With no material to work with and no clear idea of the album's
                        direction, the group devised a series of novel experiments which eventually inspired the album's
                        signature track, "Echoes". Although many
                        of the band's later albums would be unified by a central theme with lyrics written mainly
                        by Roger Waters, Meddle was a group effort with lyrical contributions from each member, and is
                        considered a transitional album between the Syd
                        Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The cover, incorporating
                        a close-up shot of an ear underwater was, as with several previous albums, designed by
                        Hipgnosis, though Storm Thorgerson was unhappy with the final
                        result.
The album was well received by music critics upon its release. However, despite
                        being commercially successful in the United Kingdom, lackluster publicity on the part of their
                        United States-based label led to poor sales there upon initial
                        release (though it would eventually be certified 2x Platinum as the band's popularity
                        increased).
Returning from a series of tours across America and England in support of Atom
                        Heart Mother, at the start of 1971 Pink Floyd commenced work on
                        new material at Abbey Road Studios in London. At the time, Abbey Road was equipped only with
                        eight-track multitrack recording facilities, which the band found insufficient for the
                        increasing technical demands of their project. They transferred their
                        best efforts, including the opening of what became "Echoes", to 16-track tape at
                        smaller studios in London (namely AIR, and Morgan in West Hampstead) and resumed work with the
                        advantage of more flexible recording equipment. Engineers John
                        Leckie and Peter Bown recorded the main Abbey Road and AIR sessions, while for minor work at
                        Morgan, Rob Black, Wayne Gregory and Roger Quested handled the engineering duties.

Lacking
                        a central theme for the project, the band used several
                        experimental methods in an attempt to spur the creative process. One exercise involved each
                        member playing on a separate track, with no reference to what the other members were doing. The
                        tempo was entirely random while the band played around an
                        agreed chord structure, and moods such as "first two minutes romantic, next two up tempo".
                        Each recorded section was named, but the process was largely unproductive; after several weeks,
                        no complete songs had been created.
Leckie had
                        worked on albums such as George Harrison's All Things Must Pass and Ringo Starr's
                        Sentimental Journey, and was employed as a tape-operator on Meddle, partly for his proclivity
                        for working into the early hours of the morning. He has said
                        that Pink Floyd's sessions would often begin in the afternoon, and end early the next
                        morning, "during which time nothing would get done. There was no record company contact
                        whatsoever, except when their label manager would show up now and
                        again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of joints." The band would apparently
                        spend long periods of time working on simple sounds, or a particular guitar riff. They also
                        spent several days at AIR attempting to create music using a
                        variety of household objects, a project which would be revisited between their next albums, The
                        Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.
Following these early experiments – called
                        Nothings – the band developed Son of Nothings, which was
                        followed by Return of the Son of Nothings – the working title of the new album. One of these
                        early works involved the use of Richard Wright's piano. Wright had fed a single note
                        through a Leslie speaker, producing a submarine-like ping. The band
                        tried repeatedly to recreate this sound in the studio but were unsuccessful, and so the demo
                        version was used on what would later become "Echoes", mixed almost exclusively at AIR
                        Studios. Combined with David Gilmour's guitar, the band
                        were able to develop the track further, experimenting with accidental sound effects (such as
                        Gilmour's guitar being plugged into a wah-wah pedal back to front). Unlike with Atom Heart
                        Mother, the new multi-track capabilities of the studio
                        enabled them to create the track in stages, rather than performing it in a single take. The
                        final, 23-minute piece would eventually take up the entire second side of the album.
"One
                        of These Days" was developed around an ostinato
                        bassline created by Roger Waters, by feeding the output through a Binson Echorec. The bass line
                        was performed by Waters and Gilmour using two bass guitars, one on old strings. Drummer Nick
                        Mason's abstruse "One of these days I'm going
                        to cut you into little pieces" line was recorded at double speed using a falsetto voice,
                        and replayed at normal speed.
Meddle was recorded between the band's various concert
                        commitments, and therefore its production was spread over a
                        considerable period of time. The band recorded in the first half of April 1971, but in the
                        latter half played at Doncaster and Norwich before returning to record at the end of the month.
                        In May they split their time between sessions at Abbey Road,
                        and rehearsals and concerts in London, Lancaster, Stirling, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Nottingham.
                        June and July were spent mainly performing at venues across Europe. August was spent in the far
                        east and Australia, September in Europe, and October to
                        November in the US. In the same period, the group also produced Relics, a compilation album of
                        some of Pink Floyd's earlier works. A quadraphonic mix of the album was prepared at Command
                        Studios on 21 and 26 September, but remains
                        unreleased.
Although the tracks possess a variety of moods, Meddle is generally considered
                        more cohesive than its 1970 predecessor, Atom Heart Mother. The largely instrumental "One
                        of These Days" is followed by "A Pillow of
                        Winds", which is distinguished by being one of the few quiet, acoustic love songs in the
                        Pink Floyd catalogue. These two songs segue into each other across windy sound effects,
                        anticipating the technique that would later be used on Wish You Were
                        Here. The title of "A Pillow of Winds" was inspired by the games of Mahjong that
                        Waters and Mason, and their wives, played while in the south of France.
The song "Fearless"
                        employs field recordings of the Liverpool F.C. Kop
                        choir singing "You'll Never Walk Alone", their anthem, which brings the song to
                        an end in a heavily reverberated fade-out. "San Tropez", by contrast, is a
                        jazz-inflected pop song with a shuffle tempo, composed by Waters in
                        his increasingly deployed style of breezy, off-the-cuff songwriting. The song was inspired by
                        the band's trip to the south of France in 1970. Pink Floyd uncharacteristically displayed
                        their sense of humour with "Seamus", a pseudo-blues
                        novelty track featuring Steve Marriott's dog (which Gilmour was looking after) howling
                        along to the music. "Seamus" often tops polls as the worst song Pink Floyd ever
                        created, but the band would later use animal sounds again, in
                        Animals.
The final song on the album is the 23-minute "Echoes". First performed as
                        "Return of the Son of Nothing" on 22 April 1971 in Norwich, the band spent about six
                        months on the track in three studios (Morgan, AIR and
                        Abbey Road). The track opens with Wright's "ping". "Echoes" was
                        recorded almost entirely at Air Studios, and completed in July 1971. "Echoes" also
                        gave its name to the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink
                        Floyd, on which a much-edited version of the title track was included. On the compilation,
                        multiple edits throughout the entire song cut the running length of the piece down by some seven
                        minutes. Some of the material composed during the creation of
                        Meddle was not used; however, one song would eventually become "Brain Damage", on The
                        Dark Side of the Moon. "Echoes" was later featured in its entirety in the 1973
                        Australian surf film Crystal Voyager, filmed, written and
                        narrated by surfer, photographer and filmmaker George Greenough during an extended section of
                        slow-motion footage shot inside the curl of wave.
In a retrospective review, Robert
                        Christgau said Meddle was a fairly good progression over the
                        group's previous work and featured folk songs highlighted by unique melodies, although he
                        lamented the lyrics to "A Pillow of Winds": "The word 'behold' should
                        never cross their filters again". In his critique of
                        "Echoes", he believed the lyrics imitate "Across the Universe" by the
                        Beatles but over 23 minutes of music that flows with a "timeless calm" similar to
                        "Interstellar Overdrive". Daryl Easlea of BBC felt it is a
                        similar, but more consistent and tuneful version of Atom Heart Mother highlighted by "Echoes",
                        which he said "dominates the entire work" and is "everything right about
                        progressive rock; engaging, intelligent and
                        compelling". In The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Rob Sheffield said "Echoes"
                        showed Pink Floyd to be a more developed group than before, "coloring the slow guitar
                        ripples with deep-in-the-studio sonic details that only
                        the truly baked would notice, much less appreciate." Writing for AllMusic, editor Stephen
                        Thomas Erlewine called Meddle the best album from their transitional years leading up to The
                        Dark Side of the Moon, as it "spends most of its time
                        with sonic textures and elongated compositions, most notably on its epic closer, 'Echoes'".
                        He noted a "uniform tone", but not song structure, and wrote of the album's
                        significance in the group's catalogue:
                        "Pink Floyd were nothing if not masters of texture, and Meddle is one of their greatest
                        excursions into little details, pointing the way to the measured brilliance of Dark Side of the
                        Moon and the entire Roger Waters era."

					<summary>The Dark Side of the Moon (titled Dark Side of the Moon in the 1993 CD edition) is a
                        concept album by the British art rock band Pink Floyd. It was released on March 17, 1973 in the
                        U.S. and March 24, 1973 in the UK.

The Dark Side of
                        the Moon builds upon previous experimentation Pink Floyd had done, especially on their album
                        Meddle. Its themes include old age, conflict and insanity; the latter possibly inspired by the
                        deteriorating mental state of their former band leader Syd
                        Barrett. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon"&gt;Read

					<content>The Dark Side of the Moon (titled Dark Side of the Moon in the 1993 CD edition) is a
                        concept album by the British art rock band Pink Floyd. It was released on March 17, 1973 in the
                        U.S. and March 24, 1973 in the UK.

The Dark Side of
                        the Moon builds upon previous experimentation Pink Floyd had done, especially on their album
                        Meddle. Its themes include old age, conflict and insanity; the latter possibly inspired by the
                        deteriorating mental state of their former band leader Syd
                        Barrett. The album is notable for its use of special effects and conceptual, philosophical
                        lyrics, as found in much of Pink Floyd’s work.

The band’s most successful release, The
                        Dark Side of the Moon spent 741 consecutive weeks (14 years) on
                        the USA-based Billboard 200 album chart, the longest duration of any album in history.It is one
                        of three albums tied for the claim of second highest selling album globally of all time, selling
                        45 million units. In addition to its commercial success,
                        The Dark Side of the Moon is often considered to be the group’s defining work, and is still
                        frequently ranked by music critics as one of the greatest and most influential albums of all
                        time. &lt;a

                        contrast, Pink Floyd's previous album, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, had peaked at #3. The
                        Division Bell was certified Gold, Platinum, and Double Platinum in the U.S. in June 1994 and
                        Triple Platinum in January 1999. Its release was accompanied
                        by an extremely successful tour documented in the P•U•L•S•E album released the following year.


History

Before
                        the Roger Waters-led period, David Gilmour stated that the music and lyrics were in balance, and
                        the importance of
                        the music was understood. The Division Bell's atmosphere is spacier, sounding more like
                        Meddle or Obscured by Clouds than the grittier and harsher tones of Animals or The Wall. David
                        Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright stated on "In the
                        Studio with Redbeard", which spotlighted The Division Bell (including interviews which were
                        recorded for the world premiere special of The Division Bell aired one week before its U.S.
                        release) that the album was the band's best since their
                        1975 release Wish You Were Here.

This release marks the first time Richard Wright had
                        sung lead vocals on a Pink Floyd album since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon, although he
                        did provide backing vocals for Wish You Were Here, Animals
                        and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. It also marks his first songwriting credit on a Pink Floyd
                        album since Wish You Were Here.

The track "Marooned" was awarded a Grammy in
                        the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the
                        Grammy Awards of 1995. This has been Pink Floyd's only Grammy to date.

EMI
                        concocted an Internet-based "puzzle" known as the Publius Enigma in connection with
                        the album's release. Officially, it was never
                        solved.


Structure

Douglas Adams, the author of The Hitchhikers Guide to
                        the Galaxy series, chose the name of the album, being a friend of David Gilmour. This came about
                        because the three band members could not agree on an album
                        title (with both "Pow Wow" and "Down to Earth" being suggested). When
                        Gilmour told Adams about the problem, Adams quickly responded that he had a title, but that he
                        would only tell Gilmour if he would donate £25,000 to the Save
                        the Rhino foundation [1]. Gilmour agreed and the name, taken from a line in the final track,
                        "High Hopes", was suggested. The phrase itself derives from the division bell, which
                        is rung in the British House of Commons, and some other
                        legislatures, to signal the commencement of a division (vote) to Members of Parliament.

Despite
                        no specific over-arching concept, there is a musical connection between the songs in the form of
                        a linking theme of communication and the lack of
                        it.[2] Tracks such as "What Do You Want from Me", "A Great Day for Freedom"
                        and "Take It Back" seem chiefly concerned with communication problems within
                        relationships[3], while "Keep Talking" is more generally
                        about the importance of maintaining a dialogue and the dangers of allowing oneself to become
                        insular[4]. Samples of Professor Stephen Hawking from a telephone company advertisement provide
                        the spoken word portions of "Keep
                        Talking".

While some songs can be interpreted as references to the then ongoing
                        relationship problems between Pink Floyd members, especially the long-standing estrangement
                        between David Gilmour and Roger Waters, Gilmour denies that the
                        album is an allegory for the split and acknowledges only "a couple of hinted mentions that
                        could or could not have something to do with him [Waters]".[5]

At the end of the
                        album, Gilmour's stepson, Charlie, can be heard
                        hanging up the telephone on Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, who had pleaded to be
                        allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.


Recording

We started off by
                        going into Nick's studio, Brittania Row studio in London, in
                        January 1993 with myself, Nick [Mason], and Rick [Wright], and Guy [Pratt], the bass player from
                        our last tour. And we just jammed away at anything for two weeks, just playing anything that we
                        had in our heads or that we made up on the spot. And then
                        we took all that over to Astoria and started listening to all the tapes and working stuff out.
                        We found that we had 65 pieces of music, which we worked on all of to a certain extent, and then
                        we started adding these things. We had a couple of
                        sessions which we called 'The Big Listen' where we listened to all these 65, and all
                        the people involved with it voted on each track, on each piece of music as to how popular it was
                        with them. And so we then arranged these 65 pieces of
                        music in order of popularity amongst the band, and then we dumped 40 of them, and worked on the
                        top 25, which in fact became the top 27 because a couple more got added in. And so the process
                        went on from there with us working away on all these pieces
                        of music and gradually either merging pieces together or scrapping them until we finally were
                        down to about twelve to fifteen things that we all kind of liked. And in the end one or two of
                        them went by the way, and we were left with eleven on the
                        album, I think. ”
-David Gilmour, Questions and Answers with David Gilmour


Reception

The
                        album was received mostly poorly by professional critics despite its strong sales. Jerry McCully
                        of Amazon.com said of the album in
                        his editorial review that "The Division Bell is not a great Pink Floyd album, but an
                        all-too-fallible simulation"[7]. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly echoed McCully's
                        sentiment, giving the album a grade of "D" and saying
                        that "avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an
                        album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity
                        and New Age noodling"[8]. Tom Graves of Rolling Stone
                        criticized lead guitarist David Gilmour's performance on the album, stating that his guitar
                        solos "were once the band's centerpieces, as articulate, melodic and well-defined as
                        any in rock, [but] he now has settled into rambling,
                        indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible", adding that "only
                        on 'What Do You Want from Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares"[9]. Waters
                        described the album as "rubbish," and mocked
                        Gilmour's decision to have his wife write many of its lyrics.[10] However, the album enjoys
                        a strong positive reputation with Pink Floyd's fanbase. Mark Henderson of the Pink Floyd
                        fansite Pink Floyd.net called the album "quite
                        possibly one of the most amazing albums of all time"[11], adding to fellow Pink Floyd.net
                        reviewer Tim Shelton's comment that The Division Bell "encompasses the best aspects of
                        the band"[12].

                        Pink Floyd, released on November 30th, 1979. It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate

					<content>The Wall is a rock opera presented as a double album by the English progressive rock band
                        Pink Floyd, released on November 30th, 1979. It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate
                        theatrical effects, and made into a
                        film.

Following in the footsteps of their previous albums, The Wall is a concept album
                        — specifically, it deals largely with the theme of isolation from one's peers. The concept
                        was largely inspired by the band's 1977 tour
                        promoting the album Animals, with regards to an incident where Roger Waters' frustration
                        with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to
                        climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a
                        wall exists. With its significantly darker theme, The Wall featured a notably harsher and more
                        theatrical sound than their previous releases.

The Wall is a rock opera that centres on
                        the character "Pink". Largely based on
                        Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in
                        war ("Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)"), abused by teachers ("The Happiest
                        Days of Our Lives"), nurtured by an overprotective
                        mother ("Mother"), and deserted by his wife later on ("Don't Leave Me Now")
                        — all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to
                        as "The Wall". Once Pink is behind his
                        Wall, he slowly becomes insane due to his isolation from his fellow man. This culminates at a
                        concert held by Pink, where he sets his "men" on fans he deems unworthy. He then puts
                        himself on trial ("The Trial") and finds himself
                        guilty for causing his problems. The album then ends with a monologue by Waters; the fate of
                        Pink is unknown.

The Wall quickly became a bestseller and was eventually certified 26x
                        platinum. It is the Floyd's second-best-selling album
                        after Dark Side of the Moon. However, The Wall contributed heavily to the split in the group
                        that came soon after its release. Roger Waters (lead vocalist) fired keyboardist Rick Wright
                        part way through the recording sessions and assumed most of the
                        creative control over the album. Pink Floyd produced just one more album, The Final Cut, which
                        was practically a Waters solo project, before Rogers finally left the band in the early 80's.

				<content>Pink Floyd are a psychedelic/progressive rock band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of rock's most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74.5
        million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums).

The band's classic lineup was Roger Waters
        (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band's founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become
        increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour's addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions,
        sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows. 

Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett’s increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to
        replace him after The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973’s The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time),
        1975’s Wish You Were Here, 1977’s Animals, and 1979’s The Wall, among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the
        remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs.

Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at
        various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members — guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright — formed a new band called
        Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band’s primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the
        spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between ‘Tea Set’ and ‘The Pink Floyd Sound’, with the latter name eventually winning out. The word
        Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as “Louie, Louie”, but
        gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and ‘spaced out’ solos.

The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an
        otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical
        humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a
        six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles "Arnold Layne" in March 1967 and “See Emily Play” in June 1967. “Arnold Layne” reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and “See Emily
        Play” reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967.

Released in August 1967, the band’s debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, is today considered to be a prime example of British
        psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album’s tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of
        music, from the avant-garde free-form piece "Interstellar Overdrive" to whimsical songs such as "The Scarecrow", inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters’s home town). Lyrics were
        entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as "The Gnome". The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at
        #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U.S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity.

As the band became more and more popular, the
        stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett’s behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many
        who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd’s playing and singing duties. With Barrett’s behavior becoming less and less predictable,
        and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar.
        The band’s live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach
        Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett’s increasingly difficult compositions, such as "Have You Got It Yet?”, which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this
        arrangement. Once Barrett’s departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O’Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd
        until his death in 2003.

Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated
        early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic
        psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band’s most experimental music is from this period, such as "A Saucerful of
        Secrets", consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, “Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict”, which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that
        reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and “Careful with That Axe, Eugene” (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums
        and Waters’s primal screams.

Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake “Jugband Blues”, appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968,
        reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U.S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett’s departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully
        showcased on Ummagumma. Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of
        their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release.

Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a
        soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More, in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U.S. The band
        would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although
        critics tend to find the collection of the film’s music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, “Green Is the Colour” and “Cymbaline”, became fixtures in the band’s live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from
        this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters’s cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as “The
        Nile Song”.

The next record, the double album Ummagumma, was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason’s first wife
        makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from “found” instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and
        lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on
        the studio disc (except for Waters’s pure folk “Grantchester Meadows”), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (“Sysyphus”), meandering folk guitar (“The Narrow Way”) and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of
        their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd’s most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U.S. charts at
        #74.

1970’s Atom Heart Mother, the band’s first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second
        side featured one song from each of the band’s then-current vocalists (Roger Waters’s folk-rock “If”, David Gilmour’s bluesy “Fat Old Sun” and Rick Wright’s psychedelic “Summer ‘68”). Another lengthy piece, “Alan’s Psychedelic Breakfast”, was a sound
        collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band’s sound. While Atom Heart Mother was
        considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U.S., although it has since been described
        by Gilmour as "a load of rubbish" and Waters as suitable for "throwing in the dustbin and never [being] listened to by anyone ever again." The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory
        such as “Echoes” in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U.S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics, which contained several
        early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters’s jazzy “Biding My Time”).

This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the “psychedelic” scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive
        band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason’s writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band’s
        masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here. The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright’s
        light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry’s saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band’s style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in
        the band’s earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band’s epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with “Echoes” from Meddle (although “Shine On You Crazy Diamond” exceeded it in total length, it was split
        in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters’s influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically.
        Wright’s last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994’s The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour’s writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett
        were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here, whose epic tracks “Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)”/"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)" were written both as a tribute and elegy to their
        friend.

The band’s sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic “Echoes” taking up the second side of the LP. “Echoes” is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long
        segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a “sonic poem”. Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be “the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced
        the idea of a theme that can be returned to.” The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother. Meddle also included the atmospheric “One of
        These Days”, a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason’s menacing one-line vocal (“One of these days, I’m going to cut you into little pieces”), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse
        quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on “Fearless”, and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on
        “A Pillow of Winds”. The latter track is one of the Floyd’s very few acoustic love songs. Waters’s role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy “San Tropez” brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics
        and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U.S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their
        most well-regarded efforts.

Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee, another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band’s first U.S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK.
        While Mason described the album years later as “sensational”, it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of “Free Four”, the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U.S., introduced Waters’s ruminations on his father’s death
        in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, “Wots…uh, the Deal” and “Childhood’s End”, also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full
        fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. “Childhood’s End”, inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour’s last lyrical contribution
        for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections
        of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (“Burning Bridges”, “The Gold It’s in the…” and “Stay” being the best respective examples for each).

The release of Pink Floyd’s massively successful
        1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon, was a watershed moment in the band’s popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968’s “Point Me At The Sky” and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U.S.
        Top 20 single (“Money”). The album became the band’s first #1 on U.S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive
        weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an
        important part of the album’s sound, exposing the band’s jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album’s texture. For example, straight rock songs such as “Money” and “Time” are placed on either side of
        mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle) in “Breathe” and female vocal-laden song “The Great Gig in the Sky” (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental “On the Run” is performed almost entirely on a single
        synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album’s lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This
        concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason’s kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as “Us and Them“‘s
        musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in “Brain Damage”. The album’s complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a
        recognizable aspect of the band’s sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies.

Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation
        album, A Nice Pair, which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii. The original
        theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of
        the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii.

Wish You Were Here, released in 1975, carries
        an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite “Shine On You
        Crazy Diamond”, a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band’s past were brought together — atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone
        solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar — in the suite’s different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, “Welcome to the Machine” and “Have a
        Cigar”, harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U.S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the
        Moon. In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording “Shine On You Crazy Diamond”. The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them
        realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour’s wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band
        members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett’s eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall.

During
        this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd’s output. Wright’s influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall. Much of the music from this period is considered secondary
        to the lyrics, which explore Waters’s feelings about his father’s death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more
        guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music’s background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother) plays
        a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut.

By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U.S. #3), the band’s music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby
        and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the
        album was recorded at Pink Floyd’s new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in
        part from George Orwell’s Animal Farm, which used “Pigs”, “Dogs” and “Sheep” as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals, but the saxophone and
        female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums’ sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it “tedious” and
        “bleak”, although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London’s Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon
        difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band’s live shows from
        then on.

1979’s epic rock opera The Wall, conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink
        Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. The Wall also included the future concert staples “Comfortably Numb” and “Run Like Hell”, with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of
        album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group’s best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on “The Trial” and from whom the band later temporarily
        distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other
        members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as “Goodbye Blue Sky” and “Nobody Home”). Wright’s
        influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall
        concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet.

Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U.S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold
        over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U.S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11.5 million
        copies in U.S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade.

A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was
        released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist
        Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, “When the Tigers Broke Free”, was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the
        compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut. Also in the film is the song “What Shall We Do Now?”, which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the
        album not used was “Hey You”, but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD
        release as a deleted scene.

1983 saw the release of The Final Cut, dedicated to Roger Waters’s father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall, this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current
        events, including Waters’s anger at Britain’s participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (“The Fletcher Memorial Home”). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the
        possibility of nuclear war (“Two Suns in the Sunset”). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright’s departure, which had not been formally announced before the album’s release. Though technically a Pink Floyd
        album, the LP’s front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: “The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason”. Roger Waters received the sole
        songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in
        his book Inside Out, drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The
        music’s tone is largely similar to The Wall’s but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like “Nobody Home” more than “Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)”. It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only
        moderately successful with fans by Floyd’s standards (UK #1, U.S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, “Not Now John”, the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour).
        The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour’s co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received
        attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts.

After The Final Cut was released, the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on
        individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour’s project.
        In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates’ projects, Mason released the album Profiles, a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured
        guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel.

Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as “a spent force creatively”, but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new
        Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K.A.O.S.. A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name “Pink Floyd” should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld
        their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as “Pink Floyd.” The suit was eventually settled out of court.

After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3,
        U.S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band’s dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin),
        this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions,
        and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour.

Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright’s limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should
        really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album.

A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled
        Delicate Sound of Thunder, and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana, set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O’Rourke (acting
        as his map-reader) crashed. O’Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material
        co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon.

1992 saw the box set release of Shine On. The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, The Wall,
        and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set’s packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark
        Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words “The Big Bong Theory”.

The band’s next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell, which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had
        been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired
        and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U.S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour’s take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall. The title was
        suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour’s girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album’s release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who
        had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by
        Wright, “Wearing the Inside Out”, Wright’s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon. Wright and Moore’s writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright’s subsequent solo album, Broken China.

At the
        end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive.

The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U.S. and featured songs
        recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London's Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon. VHS and
        Laserdisc versions of the concert at London's Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition's CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which
        caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat.

In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for "Marooned".

On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted
        into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins' frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark
        Side of the Moon - said, "I'll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd...". Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright
        (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of 'Wish You Were Here'.

1996 saw the release of Richard Wright's second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore.

A live
        recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980–1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980–81. It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band's
        best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another
        non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as "Echoes", "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", "Marooned", and "High Hopes" have had substantial
        sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U.S. charts.

In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl
        pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason's book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U.S.
        Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed "Fat Old Sun" and "The Great Gig in the Sky" in Chichester Cathedral in
        tribute.

Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters — the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The
        band performed a four-song set consisting of "Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)", "Money", "Wish You Were Here", and "Comfortably Numb", with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of
        their performance Gilmour said "thank you very much, good night" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8.

In the week
        after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon.com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%,
        Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies
        profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters
        appeared on a video screen, from Rome.

David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island, on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U.S. with a band including Richard Wright and other
        musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U.S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and
        Mason's encore performances of "Wish You Were Here" and "Comfortably Numb" marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during
        his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters' worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted
        of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters' solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K.A.O.S. were included. Waters
        is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall, with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted.

Many fans expressed hope that the band's Live 8 appearance would lead to
        a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour
        confirmed that he and Waters are on "pretty amicable terms". Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8.

On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a
        joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo
        projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert
        "that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts". Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his "finished with Pink Floyd" sentiment to "who knows".

2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's
        signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles "Arnold Layne", "See Emily Play" and "Apples and Oranges" and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. This was marked by the
        release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings.

On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in
        London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of "Arnold Layne" to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the
        final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together.

Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band's classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams
        of "Pink Floyd!" to which he responded, "Later." Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of "Roger Waters!" to which Gilmour politely responded, "Yeah, he was here
        too, now the rest of us."

In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: “I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn’t even have to be to save the world.
        It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it.”

On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that "I can’t see why I
        would want to be going back to that old thing. It’s very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn’t my joy."

In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way, containing all fourteen studio
        albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, "Which One's
        Pink?," when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either "Ain't gonna happen" or "Anything could happen". Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary,
        Wright stated that he "wouldn't mind playing the Pink Floyd 'music' again," but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members.

In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would
        be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: "Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven't absolutely said 'no' to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to
        happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age –having achieved this– I've earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next." In 2008,
        Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.

Speaking to Associated
        Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion "categorically" won't happen. Gilmour said: "The [Live 8] rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn't
        something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again
        that I take part in. It isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just that I've done that. I've been there, I've done it."

On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his
        surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd.

In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing
        to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007.

On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together
        at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life.
        Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters' appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform "Comfortably Numb" at one of Waters' upcoming performances of The
        Wall.

On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb

In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of "The Wall". He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals
        on "Comfortably Numb" at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of "Outside the
        Wall"

On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the band's back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special "Immersion"
        multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall.

On 7 July ]2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. "The Endless River". The
        record uses the 1994 ambient session known as "The Big Spliff" as its basis. The "Big Spliff" recording was expanded upon in recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record will feature material recorded by the late Rick Wright
        for the 1994 session, but will not include Roger Waters. "The Endless River" is slated to be released in October 2014.

					<summary>Aftermath, first released on 15 April 1966 by Decca Records, is the fourth British studio
                        album by The Rolling Stones. It was released in the United States on 20 June 1966 by London
                        Records as their sixth American album. The album proved to
                        be a major artistic breakthrough for the band, being the first full-length release by the band
                        to consist exclusively of Mick Jagger/Keith Richards compositions. Aftermath was also the first

					<content>Aftermath, first released on 15 April 1966 by Decca Records, is the fourth British studio
                        album by The Rolling Stones. It was released in the United States on 20 June 1966 by London
                        Records as their sixth American album. The album proved to
                        be a major artistic breakthrough for the band, being the first full-length release by the band
                        to consist exclusively of Mick Jagger/Keith Richards compositions. Aftermath was also the first
                        Rolling Stones album to be recorded entirely in the US, at
                        the legendary RCA Studios in Hollywood, California at 6363 Sunset Boulevard, and the first album
                        the band released in true stereo.

The album is also notable for its musical
                        experimentation, with Brian Jones playing a variety of instruments
                        not usually associated with rock music—including sitar on "Paint It, Black" and "Mother's
                        Little Helper", the Appalachian dulcimer on "Lady Jane" and "I Am Waiting",
                        the marimbas (African xylophone) on
                        "Under My Thumb" and "Out of Time", harmonica on "High and Dry"
                        and "Goin' Home", as well as guitar and keyboards. Much of the music was still
                        rooted in Chicago electric blues.

In August 2002 both
                        editions of Aftermath were reissued in a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO Records.

					<content>Beggars Banquet is the seventh studio album by the English rock band The Rolling Stones. It
                        was released by Decca Records in the United Kingdom and London Records in the United States in
                        December 1968. It marked a return to the band's

                        Majesties Request.
In 2003, the album was ranked number 57 on Rolling Stone magazine's
                        list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In the same
                        year the TV network VH1 named Beggars Banquet the 67th greatest album of all time. The album is
                        also featured in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
Beggars Banquet was
                        Brian Jones's last full effort with the Rolling Stones.
                        In addition to his slide guitar on "No Expectations", he played harmonica on "Dear
                        Doctor", "Parachute Woman" (along with Mick Jagger) and "Prodigal Son";
                        sitar and tambura on "Street Fighting Man";
                        mellotron on "Stray Cat Blues" and possibly backing vocals on "Sympathy for the
                        Devil".
By June 1968, the sessions were nearly completed in England, with some final
                        overdubbing and mixing to be done in Los Angeles during July.
                        However, both Decca Records in England and London Records in the US rejected the planned cover
                        design - a graffiti-covered lavatory wall. The band initially refused to change the cover,
                        resulting in several months' delay in the release of the
                        album. By November, however, the Rolling Stones gave in, allowing the album to be released in
                        December with a simple white cover imitating an invitation card. (The letters R.S.V.P. that
                        appear on this version of the cover are an abbreviation of the
                        French phrase répondez, s'il vous plaît, which means "please respond".) The idea
                        of a plain album cover was also implemented by The Beatles for their eponymous white-sleeved
                        double-album, which was released one month prior to Beggars
                        Banquet. This similarity, coupled with Beggars Banquet's later release, garnered the
                        Rolling Stones accusations of imitating the Beatles. In 1984, the original cover art was
                        released with the initial CD remastering of Beggars Banquet. &lt;a

                        featuring a bonus disc with 10 new tracks

Recording:
Exile on Main St. was written
                        and recorded between 1969 and 1972. Mick Jagger said "After we got out of our contract with
                        Allen Klein, we didn't want to give him [those
                        earlier tracks]," as they were forced to do with "Brown Sugar" and "Wild
                        Horses" from Sticky Fingers (1971). Many tracks were recorded between 1969 and 1971 at
                        Olympic Studios and Jagger's Stargroves country house in
                        England during sessions for Sticky Fingers.By the spring of 1971 the Rolling Stones had spent
                        the money they owed in taxes and left Britain before the government could seize their assets.
                        Mick Jagger settled in Paris with his new bride Bianca, and
                        guitarist Keith Richards rented a villa, Nellcôte, in Villefranche-sur-Mer, near Nice. The other
                        members settled in the south of France. As a suitable recording studio could not be found where
                        they could continue work on the album, Richards'
                        basement at Nellcôte became a makeshift studio using the band's mobile recording truck.

1st
                        Stage ar Nellcôte :
Recording began in earnest sometime near the middle of June. Bassist
                        Bill Wyman recalls the band working all night,
                        every night, from eight in the evening until three the following morning for the rest of the
                        month. Wyman said of that period, "Not everyone turned up every night. This was, for me,
                        one of the major frustrations of this whole period. For our
                        previous two albums we had worked well and listened to producer Jimmy Miller. At Nellcôte things
                        were very different and it took me a while to understand why." By this time Richards had
                        begun a daily habit of using heroin. Thousands of pounds
                        worth of heroin flowed through the mansion each week in addition to a contingent of visitors
                        that included William S. Burroughs, Terry Southern, Gram Parsons and Marshall Chess (who was
                        running the Rolling Stones' new label). Parsons was asked
                        to leave Nellcôte in early July 1971, the result of his obnoxious behaviour and an attempt by
                        Richards to clean the house of drug users as the result of pressure from the French police.
Richards'
                        substance abuse prevented him from attending
                        the sessions that continued in his basement, while Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman were often unable
                        to attend sessions for other reasons. This often left the band in the position of having to
                        record in altered forms. A notable instance was the recording
                        of one of Richards' most famous songs, "Happy". Recorded in the basement,
                        Richards said in 1982, "'Happy' was something I did because I was for one time
                        early for a session. There was Bobby Keys and Jimmy Miller. We had
                        nothing to do and had suddenly picked up the guitar and played this riff. So we cut it and it's
                        the record, it's the same. We cut the original track with a baritone sax, a guitar and
                        Jimmy Miller on drums. And the rest of it is built up
                        over that track. It was just an afternoon jam that everybody said, 'Wow, yeah, work on it'".
The
                        basic band for the Nellcôte sessions consisted of Richards, Bobby Keys, Mick Taylor, Charlie
                        Watts, Miller (a skilled drummer in his
                        own right who covered for the absent Watts on the aforementioned "Happy" and "Shine
                        a Light"), and Jagger when he was available. Wyman did not like the ambience of Richards'
                        villa and sat out many of the French sessions.
                        Although Wyman is credited on only eight songs of the released album, he told Bass Player
                        Magazine that the credits are incorrect and that he actually played on more tracks than that.
                        The other bass parts were credited to Taylor, Richards and session
                        bassist Bill Plummer. Wyman noted in his memoir Stone Alone that there was a division between
                        the band members who freely indulged in drugs (Richards, Miller, Keys, Taylor, engineer Andy
                        Johns) and those who abstained to varying degrees (Wyman, Watts
                        and Jagger)

2nd stage in Los Angeles:
Additional basic tracks (probably only "Rip
                        this Joint", "Shake Your Hips", "Casino Boogie", "Happy",
                        "Rocks Off", "Turd on the Run" and
                        "Ventilator Blues") were begun in the basement of Nellcôte and taken to Sunset Sound
                        Recorders in Los Angeles where numerous overdubs (all piano and keyboard parts, all lead and
                        backing vocals, all guitar and bass overdubs) were added
                        during sessions that meandered from December 1971 until May 1972. Some tracks (such as "Torn
                        and Frayed" and "Loving Cup") were freshly recorded in Los Angeles. Although
                        Jagger was frequently missing from Nellcôte,[6] he took
                        charge during the second stage of recording in Los Angeles, arranging for the keyboardists Billy
                        Preston and Dr John and the cream of the city's session backup vocalists to record layers
                        of overdubs.[5] The final gospel-inflected arrangements of
                        "Tumbling Dice", "Loving Cup", "Let It Loose" and "Shine a
                        Light" were inspired by Jagger and Preston's visit to a local evangelical church.
The
                        extended recording sessions and differing methods on the
                        part of Jagger and Richards reflected the growing disparity in their personal lives. During the
                        making of the album, Jagger had married Bianca, followed closely by the birth of their only
                        child, Jade, in October 1971. Richards was firmly attached to
                        his girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, yet both were in the throes of heroin addiction,[6] which
                        Richards would not overcome until the turn of the decade.

Music and lyrics:
Even
                        though the album is often described as being Richards'
                        finest moment, as Exile is often thought to reflect his vision for a raw, rootsy rock sound,
                        Jagger was already expressing his boredom with rock and roll in several interviews at the time
                        of the album's release. With Richards' effectiveness
                        seriously undermined by his dependence on heroin, the group's subsequent 1970s
                        releases—directed largely by Jagger—would experiment to varying degrees with other musical
                        genres, moving away from the roots-based sound of Exile on Main St Music
                        biographer John Perry wrote that the Rolling Stones had developed a style of hard rock for the
                        album that was "entirely modern yet rooted in 1950s rock &amp; roll and 1930s-1940s swing".
According
                        to Robert Christgau, Exile on Main St.
                        expanded on the hedonistic themes the band had explored on previous albums such as Sticky
                        Fingers: "It piled all the old themes—sex as power, sex as love, sex as pleasure, distance,
                        craziness, release—on top of an obsession with time that was
                        more than appropriate in men pushing 30 who were still committed to what was once considered
                        youth music

Release and reception: 
Preceded by the UK and US Top 10 hit "Tumbling
                        Dice", Exile on Main St was released in May 1972.
                        It was an immediate commercial success, reaching No. 1 worldwide just as the band embarked on
                        their celebrated 1972 American Tour. Their first American tour in three years, it featured many
                        songs from the new album. "Happy", sung by
                        Richards, would be a Top 30 US hit later that summer.
By the late 1970s, critics had come to
                        view Exile on Main St as the Rolling Stones' greatest album. Lenny Kaye of Rolling Stone
                        observed "a tight focus on basic components of the
                        Stones' sound as we've always known it, knock-down rock and roll stemming from blues,
                        backed with a pervading feeling of blackness that the Stones have seldom failed to handle well."
                        He felt that there are songs that are better, there
                        are songs that are worse, and others you'll probably lift the needle for when the time is
                        due", and asserted that "the great Stones album of their mature period is yet to come".
                        Other critics praised the album's rawness and
                        different styles, from blues to country to soul. Richard Williams of Melody Maker said that the
                        album "is definitely going to take its place in history" and called it "the best
                        album they've ever made", writing that it
                        "utterly repulses the sneers and arrows of outraged put down artists. Once and for all, it
                        answers any questions about their ability as rock 'n' rollers." Bill Janovitz
                        called it "the greatest, most soulful, rock &amp; roll
                        record ever made" because it seamlessly distills "perhaps all the essential elements
                        of rock &amp; roll up to 1971, if not beyond".[23] In his year-end list for Newsday,
                        Christgau named it the best album of 1972 and wrote that
                        "this fagged-out masterpiece" was the peak of rock music in 1972 and that it "explores
                        new depths of record-studio murk, burying Mick's voice under layers of cynicism, angst and
                        ennui".
On the initial critical and
                        commercial reaction, Richards said, "When [Exile] came out it didn't sell particularly
                        well at the beginning, and it was also pretty much universally panned. But within a few years
                        the people who had written the reviews saying it was a
                        piece of crap were extolling it as the best frigging album in the world."
Exile on Main
                        St featured a gatefold cover and included a series of 12 perforated postcards with a sequence of
                        images inserts, all of which were shot by photographer
                        Norman Seeff. The back cover features various photos of the Stones; the "mystery woman"
                        pictured in the lower left side is Chris O'Dell, their personal assistant. The album
                        photography and concept was by Robert Frank and includes
                        images from his seminal 1958 book The Americans. The "Joe Allen" pictured in the
                        collage is of a postcard-style advertisement by Frank of the contortionist, Joe Allen, billed as
                        "The Human Corkscrew" for his ability to wiggle and
                        twist through the "13 1/2 inch hoop" approximately 25,000 times during his circus
                        career, according to an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on 8 May 1950. The man with the
                        three balls (a tennis ball, a golf ball, and a "5"
                        billiard ball) in his mouth is formally known as "Three Ball Charlie", a 1930's
                        sideshow performer from Humboldt, Nebraska who could also not only balance on several balls at
                        once, but could also juggle balls, and whistle, all while
                        performing all 4 tasks simultaneously, according to Ripley's

					<content>Some Girls is an album by The Rolling Stones, released in 1978. Considered a highlight of
                        their output and the best of their post-Exile on Main St. records, the album revitalized the
                        band's career upon its release and re-established The

                        copies to date.
With the advent of punk rock, The
                        Rolling Stones, among many of their musical contemporaries, were being targeted by some in the
                        movement as cultural dinosaurs, compromising their standing. Mick Jagger felt invigorated by the
                        provocations and was determined to answer them lyrically.
                        It helped, however, that almost all the punks had, openly or not, idolized the Stones in the
                        1960s and were heavily influenced by the band's rebellious records from that era.

At
                        least as important for the band's reinvigoration was
                        the addition of Ronnie Wood to the lineup, as Some Girls was the first album recorded with him
                        as a full member. His guitar playing style meshed with that of Keith Richards. Wood's pedal
                        steel playing would become one of the band's
                        hallmarks, and his unconventional uses of the instrument are prominent on Some Girls. In
                        addition, Jagger, who had learned to play guitar over the previous decade, contributed a third
                        guitar part to many songs. This gave songs like
                        "Respectable" a three-guitar lineup. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Some+Girls"&gt;Read

					<content>Sticky Fingers is the ninth British and 11th American studio album by English rock band The
                        Rolling Stones, released in April 1971. It is the band's first album of the 1970s and its
                        first release on the band's newly formed label,
                        Rolling Stones Records, after having been contracted since 1963 with Decca Records in the UK and
                        London Records in the US. It is also Mick Taylor's first full-length appearance on a
                        Rolling Stones album, the first Rolling Stones album not to
                        feature any contributions from guitarist and founder Brian Jones and the first one on which
                        singer Mick Jagger is credited with playing guitar.
Sticky Fingers is widely regarded as one
                        of the Rolling Stones' best albums. It achieved triple
                        platinum certification in the US and contains songs such as the chart-topping "Brown Sugar",
                        the country ballad "Wild Horses", the Latin-inspired "Can't You Hear Me
                        Knocking", and the sweeping ballad "Moonlight
                        Mile".
With the end of their Decca/London association at hand, The Rolling Stones would
                        finally be free to release their albums (cover art and all) as they pleased. However, their
                        departing manager Allen Klein dealt the group a major blow
                        when they discovered that they had inadvertently signed over their entire 1960s copyrights to
                        Klein and his company ABKCO, which is how all of their material from 1963's "Come On"
                        to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in
                        Concert has since come to be released by ABKCO Records. The band would remain incensed with
                        Klein for decades over the act.
When Decca informed The Rolling Stones that they were owed
                        one more single, they cheekily submitted a track called
                        "Cocksucker Blues", which was guaranteed to be refused. Instead, Decca released the
                        two-year-old Beggars Banquet track "Street Fighting Man" while Klein would have dual
                        copyright ownership, with The Rolling Stones, of "Brown
                        Sugar" and "Wild Horses".


Recording
Although sessions for
                        Sticky Fingers began in earnest in March 1970, The Rolling Stones had recorded at Muscle Shoals
                        Sound Studio in Alabama in December 1969 and "Sister
                        Morphine", cut during Let It Bleed's sessions earlier in March of that year, was held
                        over for this release. Much of the recording for Sticky Fingers was made with The Rolling Stones'
                        mobile studio unit in Stargroves during the summer
                        and autumn of 1970. Early versions of songs that would appear on Exile on Main St. were also
                        rehearsed during these sessions

Artwork

Standard version:
The Rolling
                        Stones posing in an ad with the artwork from Sticky Fingers in
                        1971, from left to right: Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, and Mick
                        Jagger
The album's artwork emphasises the suggestive innuendo of the Sticky Fingers
                        title, showing a close-up of a jeans-clad male crotch with the
                        visible outline of a large penis; the cover of the original (vinyl) release featured a working
                        zipper and mock belt buckle that opened to reveal cotton briefs. The vinyl release displayed the
                        band's name and album title along the image of the
                        belt; behind the zipper the white briefs were seemingly rubber stamped in gold with the name of
                        American pop artist Andy Warhol, below which read "THIS PHOTOGRAPH MAY NOT BE—ETC."
                        While the artwork was conceived by Warhol, photography was
                        by Billy Name and design by Craig Braun.

The cover photo of a male model's crotch
                        clad in tight blue jeans was assumed by many fans to be an image of Mick Jagger, but the people
                        actually involved at the time of the photo shoot claim
                        that Warhol had several different men photographed (Jagger was not among them) and never
                        revealed which shots he used. Among the candidates, Jed Johnson, Warhol's lover at the
                        time, denied it was his likeness, although his twin brother Jay is a
                        possibility. Those closest to the shoot, and subsequent design, name Factory artist and designer
                        Corey Tippin as the likeliest candidate. Warhol "superstar" Joe Dallesandro claims to
                        have been the model.
After retailers complained that
                        the zipper was causing damage to the vinyl (from stacked shipments of the record), the zipper
                        was "unzipped" slightly to the middle of the record, where damage would be minimised.
The
                        album features the first usage of the band's
                        "tongue &amp; lips" logo, which was originally designed by Ernie Cefalu. Although
                        Ernie's version was used for much of the merchandising and was the design originally shown
                        to the band by Craig Braun, the design used for the album was
                        illustrated by John Pasche.
In 2003, the TV network VH1 named Sticky Fingers the "No. 1
                        Greatest Album Cover" of all time.

Alternative version and covers
In Spain,
                        the original cover was censored and replaced with a
                        "Can of fingers" cover, and "Sister Morphine" was replaced by a live version
                        of Chuck Berry's "Let It Rock". This version was released on the compilation
                        album Rarities 1971–2003 in 2005.
In 1992, the LP release
                        of the album in Russia featured a similar treatment as the original cover; but with Cyrillic
                        lettering for the band name and album name, a colourised photograph of blue jeans with a zipper,
                        and a Soviet Army uniform belt buckle that shows a hammer
                        and sickle inscribed in a star. The model appears to be female.


Release and
                        reception:
Sticky Fingers hit the number one spot on the British charts in May 1971,
                        remaining there for four weeks before returning at number one for a
                        further week in mid June. In the US, the album hit number one within days of release, and stayed
                        there for four weeks. In Germany it was one of only two non-German albums to reach number one in
                        1971.
In a contemporary review for the Los Angeles
                        Times, music critic Robert Hilburn said that although Sticky Fingers is one of the best rock
                        albums of the year, it is only "modest" by the Rolling Stones' standards and
                        succeeds on the strength of songs such as "Bitch" and
                        "Dead Flowers", which recall the band's previously uninhibited, furious style.
                        Jon Landau, writing in Rolling Stone, felt that it lacks the spirit and spontaneity of the
                        Rolling Stones' previous two albums and, apart from
                        "Moonlight Mile", is full of "forced attempts at style and control" in which
                        the band sounds disinterested, particularly on formally correct songs such as "Brown Sugar".
                        In a positive review, Lynn Van Matre of the
                        Chicago Tribune viewed the album as the band "at their raunchy best" and wrote that,
                        although it is "hardly innovative", it is consistent enough to be one of the year's
                        best albums.
Sticky Fingers was voted the second
                        best album of the year in The Village Voice '​s annual Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for
                        1971. Lester Bangs voted it number one in the poll and said that it was his most played album of
                        the year. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked
                        the album seventeenth on his own year-end list. In a 1975 article for The Village Voice,
                        Christgau suggested that the release was "triffling with decadence", but might be the
                        Rolling Stones' best album, approached only by Exile on Main
                        St. (1972). In his 1980 review of the album, he wrote that it reflected how unapologetic the
                        band was after the Altamont Free Concert and that, despite the concession to sincerity with
                        "Wild Horses", songs such as "Can't You Hear
                        Me Knocking" and "I Got the Blues" are as "soulful" as "Good Times",
                        and their cover of "You Gotta Move" is on-par with their previous covers of "Prodigal
                        Son" and "Love in
                        Vain".
In 1994, Sticky Fingers was ranked number ten in Colin Larkin's All Time
                        Top 1000 Albums. He stated, "Dirty rock like this has still to be bettered, and there is
                        still no rival in sight." In a retrospective review, Q
                        magazine said that the album was "the Stones at their assured, showboating peak ... A magic
                        formula of heavy soul, junkie blues and macho rock". NME wrote that it "captures the
                        Stones bluesy swagger" in a "dark-land where few
                        dare to tread". Record Collector magazine said that it showcases Jagger and Richards as
                        they "delve even further back to the primitive blues that first inspired them and step up
                        their investigations into another great American form,
                        country." In his review for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that the album still is
                        superior to "most of The Rolling Stones’ catalog".In 2003, Sticky Fingers was listed
                        as No. 63 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500
                        Greatest Albums of All Time.
In 1994, Sticky Fingers was remastered and reissued by Virgin
                        Records. It was remastered again in 2009 by Universal Music Enterprises and in 2011 by Universal
                        Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD
                        version.
On 31 March 2015, The Rolling Stones announced that Sticky Fingers will be reissued
                        (this time in relation to a new concert tour, the Zip Code Tour). These Deluxe and Super Deluxe
                        reissues will be released on 8/9 June 2015 in a variety

					<content>The American version of the album, originally subtitled but later officially called England's
                        Newest Hit Makers, is the band's debut American album and was released by London Records on
                        30 May 1964, a month and a half after the
                        British version.

The track "Not Fade Away" (the A-side of the band's

                        Got a Witness" and "Tell Me" on most versions of the American release. Upon its
                        release, The Rolling Stones reached No. 11 in the US,
                        going gold in the process. To date, this is the Stones' only American studio album that has
                        failed to place in the top five on the Billboard album charts.[6]

In August 2002, the
                        album, by now officially called England's Newest Hit
                        Makers, was reissued as a new remastered CD and SACD digipak by ABKCO.[7] &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/The+Rolling+Stones"&gt;Read

				<content>The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the "British Invasion" of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales
        are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked
        the Rolling Stones at number ten on "The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists", and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian
        Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called "Rollin' Stone Blues", and made their live debut at London's Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start
        playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier).

In January 1963, Charlie Watts joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly,
        with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer's Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond's Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog
        Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the "Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone" press campaign, which set the tone for their career.

In May 1963, the Stones were
        signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later "Come On", the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U.K. charts.

The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones,
        left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall's Bluesbreakers.

In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records
        label. In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career. He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood.

Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In
        studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. 

In 2005, the band released "A Bigger Bang". 

On December 2, 2016, the band released their first
        studio album in over 10 days, entitled "Blue &amp; Lonesome" (2016) on the Polydor label. 

All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. The end. &lt;a

					<content>Encore is the fifth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was set for release on
                        November 16, 2004, but was moved up to November 12, after the album was leaked to the Internet.
                        Encore sold 760,000 copies in its shortened three day
                        opening week and claimed the #1 spot on the Billboard Top 200. The album sold 1,632,000 copies
                        in its first two weeks of release in the United States in November, 2004. Worldwide sales of the
                        album stand at 11 million copies, with 7.8 million being
                        sold in the United States.

The shock-oriented lyrics in Eminem's previous three
                        albums were toned down somewhat in Encore in favor of a lighter approach. Eminem was already
                        beginning to show this lighter side on The Eminem Show and
                        continued it with Encore.

The album features substantially more production from Dr. Dre
                        than The Eminem Show. The Eminem Show was mostly produced by Eminem and longtime collaborator
                        Jeff Bass.

The cover for Encore, which shows Slim
                        Shady taking a "final bow", is representative of the fact that Eminem would soon plan
                        to retire his alter ego. The outro to "Encore/Curtains Down" also hints to this, as
                        Slim Shady can be heard shooting into the audience and
                        finally committing suicide by sticking a pistol in his mouth. These events are also depicted in
                        the album's inlay art. The album was also made to seem as though it was recorded live, due
                        to simulated audience claps and chants in some parts. On
                        the front of the CD there is a bullet and a mock suicide note from Eminem. it reads:

"To
                        my family and all my friends, thank you for everything. I will always love you. To all my fans,
                        I'm sorr... (the ink trails off the paper as
                        if the writer has fallen.)".

On the release date of the album, a censored version
                        was released, that edited the profanities, violent and sexual content, as well the drug
                        references from the album, and album booklet, there were different
                        lyrics on the songs "Puke", "My 1st Single" and "Just Lose It",
                        while all the profanities on all other songs were just blanked out, the clean version also had
                        the bonus disc with it too. Also the song "Ass Like
                        That" is listed as "A** Like That" on the clean version. The song 'Encore /
                        Curtains Down' took out the shooting sequence that appears at the end of the track. Also,
                        on the song 'One Shot 2 Shot' the intro to the
                        song is completely wiped from the song and the censored version starts out right at the first
                        chorus.

This is the only Eminem album that does not include a Steve Berman skit or a
                        Ken Kaniff skit (besides Infinite). However, both characters
                        reappeared on Eminem's recent studio album Relapse, which included a Steve Berman skit
                        appearing as its own track while the Ken Kaniff skit appears following the end of the song
                        'Underground' as a hidden skit. This also the first
                        Eminem major label album to not feature Dina Rae on Track 13.

The copy of the song
                        "We as Americans" was the source of controversy when, as an unreleased bootleg it
                        circulated with the lyrics "Fuck money, I don't rap for
                        dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead." Eminem was investigated by the
                        Secret Service (referenced in the video for his song "Mosh" as one of the news clips
                        on the wall). These lyrics were censored on the bonus
                        disc.

Despite being viewed by many critics as Eminem's weakest album in terms of
                        quality, three songs from the album were eventually included on Eminem's compilation album
                        Curtain Call: The Hits; Mockingbird, Just Lose It, and Like
                        Toy Soldiers.

The album did not receive a Best Rap Album nomination, making it his
                        first major album not to be nominated, following wins for The Slim Shady LP (2000), The Marshall
                        Mathers LP (2001), and The Eminem Show (2003). However, two
                        songs from the album received nominations but did not win:

 * "Encore/Curtains
                        Down", featuring Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group
 *
                        "Mockingbird" for Best Rap Solo
                        Performance

Despite the commercial success of the album, it has been subject to some
                        criticism amongst critics and fans alike for its tone and greatly simplified lyricism compared
                        to Eminem's past albums. Conversely, in terms of
                        controversy, this album attracted less notoriety than previous Eminem albums due to the fact
                        that shock-oriented lyrics were toned down somewhat in favor of a lighter approach than Eminem's
                        previous three albums. However, the album did provoke
                        some controversy over anti-Bush lyrics and lyrics that made fun of Michael Jackson, who
                        complained about Eminem's depiction of him in the video for "Just Lose It".

Eminem
                        has since acknowledged that Encore was a "good,
                        but not great" album and admitted that it wasn't up to his personal standards. He also
                        stated that around the time Encore was being made he became addicted to prescription drugs. &lt;a

                        that a follow-up album, Relapse 2, would be released
                        sometime in the second half of the year. In a press release, Eminem explained that he and Dr.
                        Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, "Putting out Relapse 2 will let
                        everyone get all of the best stuff." According to Angela
                        Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 will be a continuation of
                        Relapse. During the interview Eminem also confirmed "It's extremely close to being
                        finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on
                        it." On June 25, 2009 Eminem called into Shade 45 and said he was in the studio finishing
                        up Relapse 2 and expected a release during the fourth quarter of 2009, with Rolling Stone
                        magazine slating the album for a November 2009 release date, but
                        in November 2009, he stated that he would re-release Relapse, with extra songs, to hold fans
                        over for the release of Relapse 2 in 2010.

In another Shade 45 interview, Eminem
                        explained that the album was more "emotionally driven"
                        than the first Relapse record, which was, as he explains "[just] rap records".

When
                        premiering the debut single, Eminem also let listeners know that there weren't any skits on
                        the album, so the album would contain more songs
                        than his previous studio albums. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/Recovery"&gt;Read

					<content>Relapse is the sixth studio album by American rapper Eminem. It was released by record
                        label Interscope Records, along with subsidiaries Aftermath Entertainment and Shady Records,
                        first on May 15, 2009, followed by May 19 in the United
                        States. Relapse will be Eminem's first studio album since Encore in 2004, thus ending the
                        rapper's musical hiatus.

Since 2005, Eminem had intended to take a break from
                        recording his own music in order to become a hip hop producer
                        for other rap acts, especially for the artists signed on his own label Shady Records. Such a
                        break came when Eminem canceled the European leg of the Anger Management Tour in the summer of
                        2005 due to exhaustion and an addiction to sleeping pills. In
                        the following year, the rapper's remarriage to his former wife Kimberly Scott lasted only
                        eleven weeks before a second divorce, while his closest friend and fellow rapper DeShaun "Proof"
                        Holton was later shot and killed during an
                        altercation outside a nightclub in Detroit. Devastated by this, Eminem relapsed into
                        prescription drugs and became increasingly reclusive from the outside world, as he would rarely
                        leave his house nor appear in public.

 “ But, for some
                        reason, in hindsight, the way I felt was almost like [Proof's death] happened to just me …
                        I just went into such a dark place that, with everything, the drugs, my thoughts, everything.
                        [sic] And the more drugs I consumed, and it was all
                        depressants I was taking, the more depressed I became, the more self-loathing I became…”


                        — Eminem, XXL, Issue of June 2009

Speculation on an upcoming album by Eminem was
                        reported since mid–2007 from announcements made by artists 50
                        Cent and Stat Quo, a current and former member of Shady Records respectively. Also, rapper
                        Bizarre—member of the hip hop group D12—stated that the release of the group's third studio
                        album was on hold because Interscope Records wanted to release
                        Eminem's album first. By the end of the year, additional musicians associated with Shady
                        Records, including The Alchemist, Bishop Lamont, Cashis and Obie Trice had confirmed on
                        different occasions that the rapper was effectively working on a new
                        album. On September 12, 2007, during a call at the radio station WQHT Hot 97, Eminem stated that
                        he was in limbo and was not sure whether he would release any new material in the near future.
                        The rapper then elaborated that at that point he was
                        constantly working in the recording studio and was happy he had come to terms with his personal
                        issues.

In the initial recording stages of Relapse, record producer and long-time
                        Detroit collaborator Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers worked with
                        Eminem on twenty-five tracks during the two-year period after the rapper had received treatment
                        for his sleeping pill-addiction in 2005. Bass described the production of those songs as an
                        attempt to return to Eminem's original sound, similar to
                        The Marshall Mathers LP, and to allow the artist to rap "off the top of his head, as
                        opposed to writing a story." At the same time, according to the Eminem's song rights
                        supervisor Joel Martin, the rapper began collecting additional
                        songs without noticing it, as Eminem would often record material for other people's musical
                        projects and inevitably end up with tracks he really liked.

Eminem purchased the Effigy
                        Studio in Ferndale, Michigan in 2007, and ended his
                        working relationship with much of his former production team of the 54 Sound recording studio,
                        including the Bass Brothers. He then continued recording the album with producer Dr. Dre, who in
                        September 2007 stated his intention to dedicate two months
                        to the production of Relapse. The making of the album progressed at the Effigy Studio up to a
                        year after, as recording sessions were then moved to Miami in September 2008. Originally, Eminem
                        and Dr. Dre had planned to work in the studio for only a
                        few more days since September, but this eventually became six months. Eminem would later say the
                        two were on a hot recording streak and had collected a large amount of new music, adding to his
                        previous claim in November where the rapper estimated he
                        had recorded an estimated hundred songs in the last two years.

During this recording
                        period, a handful of songs intended for Relapse were leaked on the Internet, including an
                        incomplete version of "Crack a Bottle". The song was
                        then finished in January 2009 with additional vocals from Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Despite the leak,
                        in February 2009 the album was being completed in a state of near-total secrecy, according to
                        the British newspaper The Independent. Even Polydor
                        Records, the multinational owner of Interscope, had no information on the album at the time. On
                        April 23, Eminem suggested he and possibly Dr. Dre were the only ones in possession of the final
                        copy of Relapse, while his manager Paul Rosenberg added
                        that even Eminem's record labels were not in possession of the music at less than one month
                        from the release date in order to prevent possible bootlegging.

Relapse is produced
                        entirely by Dr. Dre, except for one song Eminem produced
                        himself. According to Eminem, to work with Dr. Dre allowed him to concentrate on the processes
                        of songwriting rather than the production, which was taken care of by Dre himself. The rapper
                        justified his choice of using Dr. Dre for the vast majority
                        of the production due to their long collaborative history and a musical "chemistry"
                        only he and Dr. Dre shared. This allowed the rapper to pick the beats from Dr. Dre's
                        catalog that challenged him rhythm-wise in order to experiment
                        with different flows. The album features guest appearances by Dr. Dre and 50 Cent.

In
                        November 2008, 50 Cent stated that the death of Eminem's close friend and fellow rapper
                        Proof, in 2006, would be an inspiration for the record's
                        material, adding that Eminem "has some really serious things to write about that he didn't
                        quite get a chance to express." Eminem too confirmed in January 2009 that the departed
                        artist would be a theme on the album, with at least one
                        song dealing with Proof's death. Otherwise, he described the music as more upbeat than
                        before, explaining that he had become a happier person and had learned to cope with his friend's
                        loss. In contrast, in April 2009 Eminem then stated that
                        the album would feature the return of his evil alter-ego Slim Shady and would be similar to the
                        dark themes of "3am", which depicts him as a psychotic serial killer during a spring
                        of homicides at late-night.


The album cover
                        for Relapse was first published through Eminem's Twitter account on April 21, 2009. It
                        illustrates a head shot of the rapper composed by a mosaic of thousands of pills. A sticker on
                        the cover resembles a prescription drug label, on which the
                        patient is Eminem and Dr. Dre is the prescribing doctor. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described the
                        cover as a reference to the rapper's struggle and addiction to prescription drugs, adding
                        that it follows Eminem's habit of displaying personal
                        issues in his art. The album booklet follows a pill prescription design, so does the back cover.
                        On the backside of the booklet is a dedication to Proof, where Eminem explains that he's
                        sober and that he tried to write a song for him, but no one
                        was good enough, therefore he dedicates the whole album to him. The CD itself is grey with the
                        big red inscription "Push Down &amp; Turn".

In 2007, Shady Records rapper
                        Cashis discussed the album, referring to it by the title King
                        Mathers, adding that it would be released later that year. However, Eminem's publicist
                        Dennis Dennehy would later deny this, stating that "there [was] no album scheduled for a
                        2007 release" and that as of August 2007 there was no
                        confirmed title either. No other official statement was made for over a year, when on September
                        15, 2008, at an event held by Shade 45 to celebrate the publication of Eminem's
                        autobiography The Way I Am, the rapper confirmed his plans to release
                        a studio album by the title of Relapse. During the party, he also previewed to the audience a
                        song called "I'm Having a Relapse".

In regards to the album's
                        release date, Rolling Stone wrote on the issue of October 2008
                        that Virgin Megastores had planned to distribute Relapse on November 27, 2008, coincidentally on
                        Thanksgiving in the United States. On October 27, a spokesperson for Interscope explained that
                        there was no official date at the time, and that any
                        release dates that had been posted on any website were unfounded. In a phone conversation during
                        the finale of Total Request Live on November 16, 2008, Eminem asserted that Relapse would be
                        released during the first quarter of 2009, precisely during
                        either of the first two months of the year, explaining that he was in the process of selecting
                        the songs for the album.

Despite the leak two months before, "Crack a Bottle"
                        was eventually released for legal paid digital download as
                        well as a promotional single on February 2, 2009 and also reached the number one position on the
                        U.S. Billboard Hot 100, while, according Eminem's manager Paul Rosenberg, a music video for
                        the song was produced and directed by Syndrome, but has
                        not been released thus far. At the time of the release, various contradicting reports disputed
                        whether the song would be included on Relapse. Despite the initial confusion, in a press release
                        head label Universal Music Group eventually confirmed the
                        single's inclusion on the album. In similar press statements, since March 5, Universal made
                        public the regional release dates for Relapse. The album will be available as early as May 15,
                        2009 in Italy and the Netherlands, while it will be sold
                        in most European countries and Brazil on May 18, and the following day also in the United States
                        and Australia. Additionally, the record label also announced a second album by Eminem, Relapse
                        2, which will be released by the end of the year. Eminem
                        explained that he and Dr. Dre had recorded a considerable amount of music and thus, by releasing
                        two albums would allow listeners to have access to all of his music.

After the release
                        of "Crack a Bottle", the music video of the
                        single "We Made You" was aired on April 7, and became available for purchase a week
                        later on April 13. The video was directed by Joseph Kahn and premiered simultaneously on several
                        MTV channels, as well as MTV's website. On April 28,
                        the third overall single for the album, "3am", was released once again for paid music
                        download. A music video for "3am" was directed by Syndrome and filmed in Detroit. It
                        premiered on May 2 on Cinemax, several days after a trailer
                        for the video was posted online. Two more singles were distributed prior to the album's
                        release, as "Old Time's Sake" and "Beautiful" went on sale on the
                        iTunes Store on May 5 and May 12 respectively.

Previously
                        on April 4, 2009, Eminem was featured on CBS during the network's coverage of the 2009 NCAA
                        Final Four, in segment where he recited the spoken word "Love Letter to Detroit".
                        Later on the same day, the rapper inducted the hip hop group
                        Run-D.M.C. to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Adam Graham of The Detroit News described this as
                        "all part of the calculated promotional push" for Relapse. The rapper will perform
                        live at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards on May 31, while he will
                        also be featured on the covers of hip hop magazines Vibe and XXL in their respective issues of
                        June 2009. Eminem also announced through his website that an iPhone game to accompany the album
                        is set to be released on May 19, 2009. &lt;a

					<summary>The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by Eminem, released in 2002.

The Eminem
                        Show was the best-selling album of 2002. At the Grammy Awards of 2003 it was nominated for Album
                        of the Year and became Eminem's third straight
                        LP to win the award for Best Rap Album. It has been certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA, has sold

					<content>The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by Eminem, released in 2002.

The Eminem
                        Show was the best-selling album of 2002. At the Grammy Awards of 2003 it was nominated for Album
                        of the Year and became Eminem's third straight
                        LP to win the award for Best Rap Album. It has been certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA, has sold
                        over 9.2 million copies in the U.S., and over 19 million albums worldwide. In 2003, the album
                        was ranked number 317 on Rolling Stone magazine's list
                        of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

The Eminem Show was first scheduled for a June
                        2002 release, however pirated and bootleg copies appeared online on peer-to-peer networks and
                        began surfacing on the streets. Interscope decided to
                        release the album early on May 28 to combat bootlegging. However, many stores in the U.S. began
                        selling it early on Sunday May 26. Despite the confusion over the exact release date, the album
                        still managed to have a wildly successful debut on the
                        charts.

The album was met with both critical and commercial success. The record became
                        Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album and also swept the MTV Music
                        Video Awards winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of
                        the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The Eminem Show was Eminem's most successful
                        album in terms of charting singles. It spawned two top ten and four top fifteen singles with
                        "Without Me", "Cleanin' Out My
                        Closet", "Sing For The Moment" and "Superman", which managed to reach
                        the top ten without a video counterpart. "Business" was also released as an airplay
                        single but did not chart as high as the others. &lt;a

Often cited
                        as Eminem's magnum opus, The Marshall Mathers LP has been ranked as one of the greatest
                        hip-hop albums of all-time by such magazines as Rolling Stone,
                        Time, and XXL. Rolling Stone placed the album at number 7 on its list of the best albums of the
                        2000s. The album was ranked number 302 by Rolling Stone on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums
                        of All Time. In 2010, Rhapsody featured it on its list of
                        "The 10 Best Albums By White Rappers".

n the album's title, The Marshall
                        Mathers LP is a more serious and personal album than his major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP,
                        which predominantly featured his exaggerated Slim Shady
                        persona. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who
                        criticized his first album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, most notably
                        his mother and Kim Mathers, his former wife.

The Marshall
                        Mathers LP was released in both clean and explicit versions. However, some lyrics of the album
                        are censored even on its explicit version, making it an extremely explicit album. Some songs are
                        censored because of events surrounding the album's
                        release. These include the lines "I take seven kids from Columbine, stand 'em all in
                        line" from "I'm Back", "Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
                        It doesn't matter your attorney Fred Gibson's a
                        faggot!" from "Marshall Mathers". Unlike Eminem's debut, The Slim Shady LP,
                        The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and less of the Slim Shady persona.
                        Eminem's lyrical topics range from the controversy
                        surrounding his lyrics to the Columbine High School massacre. Most songs cover Eminem's
                        childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother ("Marshall Mathers"), the
                        relationship struggles with his wife ("Kim"), his
                        struggles with his superstardom and expectations ("Stan","I'm Back"),
                        his return and effect on the music industry ("Remember Me?", "Bitch Please II"),
                        his drug use ("Under the Influence",
                        "Drug Ballad"), his effect on the American youth and society ("The Way I Am")
                        ("Who Knew"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark
                        themes ("Criminal", "Kill You").
                        Throughout the entire album, the listener is presented with a mix of dark themes, controversy,
                        and life stories. Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on
                        the album were overwhelmingly well-received among critics and
                        the hip-hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.
                        Eminem went on to answer his critics more frequently in some of his later works.

The
                        album contains various lyric samples and references. It features
                        a number of lines mimicking songs from Eric B. &amp; Rakim's album Paid in Full. The chorus
                        to "The Way I Am" resembles lines from the song "As the Rhyme Goes On", and
                        the first two lines from the third verse of
                        "I'm Back" are based on lines from "My Melody". In "Marshall
                        Mathers", Eminem parodies the song "Summer Girls" by LFO when he says "New
                        Kids on the Block sucked a lotta dick, boy-girl groups make me
                        sick" singing the same melody of the "Summer Girls", when the original line is
                        "New Kids on the Block had a bunch of hits, Chinese food makes me sick".

The
                        clean version of the album is only slightly censored, as it
                        leaves "ass", "shit", "bitch", "goddamn", "faggot"
                        and "nigga" uncensored. The only censored profanities are "fuck" and a few
                        other words which were deemed inappropriate which are
                        normally either backmasked or blanked. However, the line from "The Real Slim Shady",
                        "fuck him and fuck you too" was bleeped out as a reference/joke on television
                        censorship. The only content significantly edited were offensive
                        and violent parts that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, gays, and schools such as
                        Columbine, and even the names of guns were censored out, along with the sound effects of guns
                        firing bullets is completely cut (in response to the recent
                        Columbine massacre). Explicit drug content and alcohol references are also removed. On many
                        copies, the 25-second "Public Service Announcement" is shortened to just two seconds
                        of silence. On other copies though, the track is still left
                        fully intact. On the clean version, the song "Kim" was completely removed because of
                        the violent messages aimed at his wife and was replaced with the South Park themed song "The
                        Kids", which was about doing drugs.

The
                        Marshall Mathers LP contains references to Eminem's feud with Insane Clown Posse: A skit
                        entitled "Ken Kaniff" parodies the group members Shaggy 2 Dope and Violent J
                        performing fellatio on Eminem's recurring character Ken Kaniff,
                        while in the song "Marshall Mathers" Eminem raps "I was put here to put fear in
                        faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer and call themselves "clowns" cause they look
                        queer/Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay/claimin' Detroit, when
                        y'all live twenty miles away...", as well as "Slim Anus/You damn right, Slim
                        Anus/I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flamin' faggots."

Much
                        of the first half of the album is produced by Dr. Dre and
                        Mel-Man, who typically employ sparse, stripped-down beats, allowing Eminem's rapping to
                        take center stage. Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from
                        the laid-back guitars of "Marshall Mathers" to the
                        gritty atmosphere of "Amityville." The only outside producer on the album is The 45
                        King, who sample the chorus of Dido's song "Thank You" for "Stan",
                        while adding a slow bass line.

During the first week of
                        sales, the album sold 1.76 million copies, becoming the fastest-selling rap album in history,
                        more than doubling the previous record held by Snoop Dogg's 1993 debut Doggystyle, and
                        topping Britney Spears' record for highest one-week sales
                        by any solo artist. The Marshall Mathers LP is still Eminem's best-selling album. The album
                        sold 800,000 in its second week, 598,000 in its third week, and 519,000 in its fourth week for a
                        four week total of 3.65 million, and became one of few
                        albums to sell over half a million copies for four consecutive weeks. It finished out the year
                        2000 as the second highest selling album of the year with over 7.9 million sold. In 2010, the
                        Nielsen Company reported that up until November 2009, the
                        album had sold 10,216,000 units in the US, making it the fourth-best selling album of the
                        decade. The album's US shipments have earned it a 9x Platinum certification from the RIAA.

On
                        October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert
                        in Toronto's Skydome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada
                        should stop Eminem at the border. "I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who
                        will come here and advocate violence against women," he
                        said. Flaherty claims to have been "disgusted" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's
                        song "Kill You", which includes lines like "Slut, you think I won't choke no
                        whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her
                        throat no more?" The opinion of the general public to the requests made by the province was
                        negative. Eugenia Lopes, an 18-year old who held concert tickets, said "If you're
                        going to blame music, you also have to blame movies. You
                        can't just blame one source." Others said the issue was one of free speech. Liberal
                        MPP Michael Bryant suggested that the government lay hate crime charges against Eminem for
                        advocating violence against women in his lyrics. In a Globe and
                        Mail editorial, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, "Being offensive is Eminem's job
                        description." Eminem's Toronto concert went on as planned that night.

Protests
                        against the album's content reached a climax when it
                        was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year, marking the first time
                        a hardcore rap album was ever nominated in this category. At the ceremony, Eminem performed
                        "Stan" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John
                        playing piano and singing the chorus, as a response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed
                        his lyrics were homophobic. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against
                        Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and
                        debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.

Despite the controversy
                        surrounding the album and its commercial success, the album received general favorable reviews
                        from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a
                        normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an
                        average score of 79, based on 20 reviews. Critic and writer Robert Christgau from Village Voice
                        applauded the album and declared it "a work of art whose
                        immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's
                        both personal and political." Christgau also acknowledged Eminem as exceptionally witty,
                        musical, discernibly thoughtful, and good-hearted. Allmusic
                        called the album fairly brilliant and noted its production for its liquid basslines, slight
                        sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. NME gave the album a 9 out of 10 rating and described
                        it as a "gruelling assault course of lyrical genius".
                        Entertainment Weekly commended the album for its diversity, calling it "indefensible and
                        critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable" and "the
                        first great pop record of the 21st century". Online music
                        magazine Pitchfork Media placed The Marshall Mathers LP at number 119 on their list of top 200
                        albums of the 2000s. In 2010, Rhapsody (online music service) featured it on its list of "The
                        10 Best Albums By White Rappers".

In 2002,
                        French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the
                        beat for "Kill You" was stolen from his song.

                        "California Gurls (feat. Snoop Dogg)" and the album's title track, "Teenage
                        Dream" amongst them. All of the songs released were #1 hits on Billboard's Hot 100
                        (with the exception of the last single, The One That Got
                        Away" which peaked at #3).

Before she began to record the album, Perry told
                        Rolling Stones magazine, "The second record is really important to me because I think it
                        shows whether I'm meant to do this, or I got lucky. Basically
                        what I want to do is not alienate the audience that I have at all. I think some people feel like
                        they have had success with one thing and one idea and one record and they want to pull a 180 and
                        try a totally different thing, I definitely feel like
                        that's the wrong move. I feel like you just have to grow from it, you can branch off of it
                        but keep the tree the same in some ways. Some people get full of themselves, and they think that
                        anything they do is going to work or turn to gold or be
                        the right move, and the reason why you're here is because of the people that like your
                        music and the fans, so you always should keep an ear open to what they're saying."
                        Perry said she would "definitely keep it pop.
                        "Lovefool" by the Cardigans meets "Into the Groove" by Madonna but a little
                        more meat on the bones lyrically. I'm not just gonna talk about the beat and just dancing,
                        I like to get into the meaning." She began recording
                        the album in October 2009.

The album cover was released in mid-July on Katy Perry's
                        official website. It is a painting of Katy naked lying down on pink clouds. The official cover
                        also doesn't include text. However, text was added
                        to the cover in some countries. In some areas, the album also will include a scratch-and-sniff
                        cover which will have the scent of cotton candy. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry/Teenage+Dream"&gt;Read

				<content>Katy Perry (born Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson on 25 October 1984) is a singer/songwriter from Santa Barbara, California, United States. Since the release of her 2007 debut single "Ur So Gay", Perry has released four albums -
        2008's "One of the Boys", 2010's "Teenage Dream", 2013's "Prism", and 2017's "Witness".- and has had nine Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit singles.

Under the name Katy Hudson, she released
        a self-titled gospel album in 2001, which was unsuccessful. She later recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed the majority of a solo album from 2004–05, the later of which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music
        Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single "Ur So Gay" that November, which garnered public attention but failed to chart. She rose to fame with the
        release of her second single "I Kissed a Girl" in 2008, which went on to top international charts. Perry's first mainstream studio album One of the Boys followed later that year and subsequently became the 33rd-best selling album
        worldwide of 2008. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, while "I Kissed a Girl" and her second single "Hot n Cold" both received multi-platinum certifications.

Her
        second studio album Teenage Dream was released in August 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album includes five Billboard chart-toppers "California Gurls", "Teenage Dream", "Firework", and
        "E.T." and "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)", making Teenage Dream only the second album - after Michael Jackson's Bad - to have five songs reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. With "E.T." at number one on the chart of
        May 12, 2011, Perry became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.

Perry was credited as a guest judge on the seventh series of British television show The X Factor, has released a
        fragrance called "Purr", and voices Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs. Perry had a long relationship with Travie McCoy; she married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010. After 14 months of marriage, Brand filed for divorce from Perry on
        December 30, 2011, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became effective in July 2012.

Prism is the fourth studio album by Perry. The album was released on October 18, 2013. Prism topped the US album charts with
        first week sales of 286,000 becoming Perry's best opening week to date. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katy+Perry"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License;

					<summary>Coexist is the second studio album by English indie pop group The xx, released on 5
                        September 2012 by Young Turks. After a break from touring for their 2009 debut album xx, the
                        group's members began writing songs individually before
                        recording the album during November 2011 to May 2012. Guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist
                        Oliver Sim drew on personal experiences for their songwriting. For Coexist, The xx drew on the
                        electronic dance music that occured when they were away on
                        tour in 2010. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+xx/Coexist"&gt;Read more on

                        group's members began writing songs individually before
                        recording the album during November 2011 to May 2012. Guitarist Romy Madley Croft and bassist
                        Oliver Sim drew on personal experiences for their songwriting. For Coexist, The xx drew on the
                        electronic dance music that occured when they were away on
                        tour in 2010. It was produced by group member Jamie xx, who had pursued electronic dance on
                        other projects and developed as a DJ prior to the album.
The album was promoted with two
                        singles—"Angels" and "Chained". The xx
                        promoted the album with an international tour during June to September 2012. Upon its release,
                        Coexist received generally positive reviews from music critics, who complimented Croft and Sim's
                        performances, Jamie xx's production, and the
                        music's refinement of their sound. The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart,
                        the group's first number-one album in the United Kingdom. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+xx/Coexist"&gt;Read

					<summary>xx is the debut album by English indie pop band the xx. After they signed a contract with
                        XL Recordings, the band recorded the album from December 2008 to February 2009 at the label's
                        in-house studio in London. Audio engineer Rodaidh
                        McDonald worked with the xx during the recording sessions and strived to reproduce the intimate,

				<content>The xx are a Mercury Prize-winning trio formed in 2005 in London, United Kingdom and signed to Young Turks. The band members are Romy Madley Croft (vocals, lead guitar), Oliver Sim (vocals, bass guitar), and Jamie Smith, known as Jamie xx
        (beats, MPC sampler). Second guitarist and keyboardist Baria Qureshi was dropped from the band mid-tour in 2009. The reasons behind her ousting remain unclear.

On 17 August 2009, the group released their debut album xx on Young Turks label.
        The album was recorded in a small garage and produced by the band. It garnered critical acclaim and has been generally well-received, scoring an average of 86/100 based on 24 professional reviews. Also it ranked on "best of the year" lists
        with Rolling Stone placing it at #9 and NME placing it at #2.

Four singles were released from their debut album: "Crystalised", "Basic Space", "Islands" and "VCR".

The xx also remixed the
        classic song "You've Got The Love" originally written by The Source and covered by Florence + the Machine. They also added their own vocals on the song. The group won the 2010 Mercury Prize for their album on 7th September 2010. After
        being the bookies' favourites for many of the weeks leading up to the announcement, they beat eleven other acts.

"Angels" was the first single from The xx’s second album, Coexist. It was released on July 16 2012. A second
        track from the album, "Chained", was released on line prior to the official Coexist launch on 11 September.

In June 2014, it was revealed in an interview with Dazed that the trio were working on their third studio album, with
        producer Rodaidh McDonald at the Marfa Recording Company studio in Marfa, Texas. Further writing and recording sessions were held in London, New York, Reykavik and Los Angeles. The 2016 album 'I See You' title and tracklist, were revealed
        after untitled audio clips uploaded to Spotify were matched on Shazam. 'On Hold' was launched on November 10th.

					<content>...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica.
                        Elektra Records released the album on August 25, 1988. This is the first Metallica studio album
                        to feature bassist Jason Newsted, since it is the first
                        after the tragic death of the group's former bassist Cliff Burton.

The album's
                        dark subject material, featuring references to nuclear apocalypse, injustice in the law system,
                        limited freedom, war, insanity and hate, is accompanied
                        by the most complex song structures to this date in Metallica's discography. The album is
                        also noted for its near lack of bass guitar and dry production and therefore has been called a
                        "slightly flawed masterpiece and the pinnacle of
                        Metallica's progressive years" by allmusic.com's reviewer.

The front
                        cover depicts the statue of Lady Justice cracked and bound by ropes, with both of her scales
                        filled with dollars and both of her breasts exposed. The words
                        "…And Justice for All" are written in graffiti to the right. The cover is made by
                        Stephen Gorman after a concept by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.

The album has sold
                        over 8 million copies in the US alone according to the RIAA and
                        was the best selling Metallica record upon its release. Metallica released four singles from
                        …And Justice for All, "Eye of the Beholder", "Harvester of Sorrow", "…And
                        Justice for All" and
                        "One".

Production 

The production of the album is noted for its
                        unusual, and at times "one-dimensional", post-production mix. The quality of the album's
                        sound has been described as "cold",
                        "thin" and "flat", due in part to the way the instruments were recorded. The
                        bass drums don't "thud" so much as "click", while the guitars "buzz
                        thinly". And, in one of the more famous of
                        Hetfield and Ulrich's controversies with bassist Jason Newsted, the album's production
                        almost completely lacks identifiable bass in most songs. This has been attributed to various
                        reasons, such as Newsted's doubling of Hetfield's
                        guitar parts, his absence from the mixing sessions (where he might have asserted his opinion)
                        and the lingering issue of his "newness" within the band following the tragic death of
                        Cliff Burton in September 1986. As said by the band in
                        their magazine SO WHAT!, they wish that they could re-mix the entire album because the drums and
                        guitar overpower the bass completely. The album was released on two LPs at the usual single-LP
                        price, since the band thought that putting the album on a
                        single record would have diminished its fidelity.

Lyrical themes

The lyrics on
                        …And Justice for All discuss politics and social issues; however, lyricist James Hetfield is
                        more direct than ever before in his views. At the same time,
                        and despite Hetfield's aggressive singing style, the lyrics refrain from overt
                        confrontation or ringing calls for revolutionary change. Instead, as drummer Lars Ulrich
                        explained it, the ideas expressed in the lyrics merely represented
                        "interests" of the band, and were meant largely to be "documentary" in
                        nature. Important themes in the songs include destruction of Earth in "Blackened",
                        injustice in the law system in "…And Justice for All",
                        limited freedom in "Eye of the Beholder", war and locked-in syndrome in "One",
                        cheating and lying in "The Shortest Straw", infanticide in "Harvester of Sorrow",
                        insanity in "The Frayed Ends of
                        Sanity", the death of Cliff Burton in "To Live Is to Die" and hatred of authority
                        in "Dyers Eve".

Connections with other Metallica albums

The album
                        continues the trends set by the previous albums Ride the
                        Lightning and Master of Puppets by having a fast paced, striking song with a melodic, slow intro
                        as the first track, the title track as the second track, a slower, heavier track as the third
                        track, a heavy metal ballad as the fourth track, a
                        fast-paced track as the fifth track, a track slower than the fifth track as the sixth track, and
                        an instrumental or mostly instrumental track as well as a fast, heavy song as the final tracks.
                        However, in the case of this album, a song is added onto
                        the structure ("The Frayed Ends of Sanity").


It has been noted by
                        several people that the complexity of the songs on …And Justice for All was a direct reason for
                        the more simple structures on Metallica's next album, The
                        Black Album. Allmusic.com's reviewer Steve Huey also pointed out that …And Justice for All's
                        unusual production may have led Metallica to a more "professional" producer, Bob Rock.
                        It can be said that …And Justice for All marked
                        the end of Metallica's thrash metal period, at least until their newest album, Death
                        Magnetic.

Critical response

...And Justice for All was Metallica's
                        breakthrough album and reached #6 in the Billboard charts. Though it
                        would soon be over-shadowed commercially by the band's following album (1991's
                        Metallica), this album nevertheless confirmed Metallica's large-scale arena status.

The
                        album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard
                        Rock/Metal Performance in 1989, but with much controversy, it lost to Jethro Tull's Crest
                        of a Knave. In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by
                        Entertainment Weekly.

In 1990, "One" received
                        the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, as well as being Metallica's first
                        Grammy Award.

The guitar solo of "One" was ranked #7 in Guitar World's
                        compilation of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all
                        time.

The album was ranked at number nine in IGN's Top 25 Metal Albums.

Metallica
                        released their first music video for "One", after years of resisting pressure to
                        release videos for their tracks. The video incited
                        controversy among their fans, who had valued the band's apparent opposition to MTV and
                        other forms of mainstream commercial metal. "One" entered the Top 40 on March 25, 1989
                        at #35.

Live performances

Hammett noted the
                        length of the songs being problematic for fans and the band. "Touring behind it, we
                        realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long," he said. "One
                        day after we played 'Justice' and got off the stage
                        one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again.'"

In
                        spite of this, the song "One" quickly gained a permanent fixture in the band's
                        live playlist since the release of the album. The only other
                        song from …And Justice For All that has come close to this is "Harvester of Sorrow," a
                        song that was played live heavily after the album's release but has only begun to be played
                        again recently.

16 years after "Dyers
                        Eve" was recorded, on March 5, 2004, the band performed the song in its entirety for the
                        first time ever on the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, at the Great Western Forum in Los
                        Angeles, California.

On June 28, 2007, Metallica
                        played the title track for the first time since October 1989, in Lisbon on the first show of
                        their Sick of the Studio '07 tour and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that
                        routing. In 2008, "...And Justice for All" was played
                        again during their 2008 Tour.

To date, "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" and "To
                        Live Is to Die" remain the only songs from the album that have never been performed live in
                        their entirety. Instead, the band played segments of
                        them during solos or impromptu jams.

Along with "Dyers Eve", "To Live Is
                        to Die" is one of the most demanded songs to be played live of Metallica's catalogue,
                        it is unknown if Metallica will play this song live, due
                        to the song being made up of deceased bassist Cliff Burton's final riff tapes. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/...and+Justice+for+All"&gt;Read

					<content>Death Magnetic was released on September 12, 2008. Metallica's ninth studio album, it
                        was the first to be produced by Rick Rubin. It was recorded April 2007–May 2008.

It is
                        the band's first studio album to feature current
                        bassist Robert Trujillo. Death Magnetic is also the band's first studio album released
                        through Warner Bros. Records, although they still remain with Warner Music Group, which also
                        owns their previous label, Elektra Records. Outside of North
                        America, they are distributed by Universal Music Group as they remain signed to Vertigo Records
                        in the United Kingdom. 

The album was well received by fans and critics alike, and has
                        been considered a return to form for the band in the mold
                        of the band's classic albums Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, and ...And Justice for
                        All. However, it has been criticised for its sound quality, as all commercially available
                        releases were mixed at an unusually loud volume that resulted in
                        digital clipping, causing the album to have low dynamic range and a muffled sound. The album's
                        mastering engineer Ted Jensen stated that he was dissatisfied with the final product. The
                        version of the album released through Guitar Hero III did
                        not feature these problems, and several fan-made mixes of this version became popular as a
                        result. A remaster of the album featuring significantly expanded dynamic range was eventually
                        released through iTunes in 2015 and through Metallica's
                        official website in 2016.

Four outtakes from this album's sessions were released
                        in 2012 as Beyond Magnetic.

					<summary>Kill 'Em All is Metallica's first studio album. Some of the songs were written by
                        a different line-up than the musicians that played the songs in the studio. It was recorded at
                        Music America Studios, Rochester, New York. It was
                        released by Megaforce on July 29, 1983 and later re-released by Elektra records.

Before
                        Kill 'Em All was recorded, the songs were written and recorded as demos by James Hetfield,
                        Lloyd Grant, Ron McGovney and Lars Ulrich. On later demos

                        Lloyd Grant, Ron McGovney and Lars Ulrich. On later
                        demos, featuring the first full tracks that would appear on Kill 'Em All, Dave Mustaine
                        took Lloyd's place and Ron was replaced by Cliff Burton. Mustaine was kicked from the band
                        for having a bad attitude and was replaced by the final
                        Metallica lead guitarist Kirk Hammett. With this final line-up Kill 'Em All was recorded.

The
                        album features a lot of Metallica's remarkable thrash songs such as: Seek &amp; Destroy,
                        Whiplash and The Four Horsemen. Unlike the later
                        albums, Kill 'Em All didn't have any symphonic sounds or instruments supporting the
                        tracks.

The original title of the album was supposed to be Metal Up Your Ass and it had
                        a different cover artwork (hand with a dagger sticking out
                        from WC). Megaforce permissed it. The title Kill 'Em All was what Cliff Burton said after
                        the record company rejected the original Metal Up Your Ass cover. "Just fuckin' kill
                        'em all" were his exact words.

					<summary>Load is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released June 4,
                        1996. To date, the album has sold over 5 million copies in America, and is certified Gold in the
                        UK, having sold over 100,000 copies. It spent four

At 78:59 minutes, Load is Metallica's

					<content>Load is the sixth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released June 4,
                        1996. To date, the album has sold over 5 million copies in America, and is certified Gold in the
                        UK, having sold over 100,000 copies. It spent four
                        consecutive weeks at #1 on Billboard 200.

At 78:59 minutes, Load is Metallica's
                        longest studio album. Initial pressings of the album were affixed with stickers that boasted its
                        long playtime, simply reading "78:59".
                        Consequently, "The Outlaw Torn" had to be shortened by about one minute to fit on the
                        album. The full version was released on a single for "The Memory Remains" as "The
                        Outlaw Torn (Unencumbered by Manufacturing Restrictions
                        Version)" with a running time of 10:48. 

According to drummer Lars Ulrich: "This
                        album and what we're doing with it - that, to me, is what Metallica are all about:
                        exploring different things. The minute you stop exploring,
                        then just sit down and fucking die."

The songwriting dispenses almost entirely
                        with the thrash metal style that characterized the band's sound in the 1980s. In place of
                        staccato riffs, Hetfield and lead guitarist Kirk Hammett
                        experimented with more blues-based tones and styles. Additionally, Ulrich adopted a minimalist
                        approach to his drum recording, abandoning the speed and complex double bass patterns of
                        previous albums.

Most of this blues-based metal comes
                        from of Ulrich's Deep Purple influences; one can hear Ian Paice's style in the regular
                        cymbal attacks and drum hits, as well as Ritchie Blackmore's blues licks from the Mark III
                        era of Deep Purple. &lt;a

					<content>Master of Puppets is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. The
                        album was recorded in 1985 and released by Elektra Records on March 3, 1986 in North America.

Now
                        widely considered a classic of thrash metal,
                        the album proved to be a modest commercial success upon its release by reaching #29 on the U.S.
                        Billboard 200, making it the very first thrash metal album to crack the Top 40. With the band's
                        rising popularity from the release of Metallica,
                        awareness of the album has increased, and according to the RIAA, it has sold over six million
                        copies in the U.S. alone. It was the last album the band recorded with bass player Cliff Burton,
                        who died in a tour bus crash six months after it was
                        released.

Historical significance

The band's line-up during the album's
                        recording was James Hetfield on vocals and rhythm guitar, Lars Ulrich on drums, Kirk Hammett on
                        lead guitar, and Cliff Burton on bass. The album is
                        remembered in part due to the death of Burton shortly after the release of the album in a bus
                        accident while supporting the album on tour.

When it was released, Master of Puppets
                        provided many metal fans with an alternative image to the
                        commercially popular glam metal bands, such as Poison, Bon Jovi,Mötley Crüe, and Ratt. The album
                        has frequently been tagged by critics as "one of the most influential heavy metal albums of
                        all time."

As an early parody of the
                        PMRC's "explicit lyrics" warning labels, many prints of Metallica's 1986
                        release of Master of Puppets sported a sticker on the front in the shape of a stop-sign saying:


                        "The only track you probably won't want
                        to play is "Damage, Inc." due to the multiple use of the infamous "F" word.
                        otherwise, there aren't any "Shits," "Fucks," "Pisses,"
                        "Sucks," "Cunts,"
                        "Motherfuckers," or "Cocksuckers" anywhere on this record"

To
                        celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release, Metallica played the album in its entirety on
                        their Escape from the Studio '06 tour, for the first
                        time ever at the Rock am Ring festival on June 3, 2006. These concerts included the first-ever
                        complete performances of the instrumental "Orion" (though portions of the song's
                        lengthy middle section had been performed at various times
                        as part of instrumental medleys and bass solos since the early 1990s).

The title track
                        was ranked Number 51 in the "The Greatest Guitar Solos" from Guitar World. In 2006,
                        the album was voted the fourth "greatest guitar album
                        of all time" in Guitar World. And the April 5, edition of Kerrang! was dedicated to it,
                        providing readers with the cover album "Master of Puppets: Remastered". In March 2007,
                        the guitar magazine Total Guitar ranked the 100 greatest
                        riffs of all time, and the main riff in the album's title track was ranked number one.

Former
                        Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine has long claimed to have written the riff for "Leper
                        Messiah". Metallica has denied
                        it.

In 1999, Master of Puppets was re-released with Ride the Lightning in a remastered
                        audiophile Gold CD edition mixed by renowned engineer Steve Hoffman.

Reception

Upon
                        its release, Master of Puppets was immediately
                        commercially successful, selling over half a million copies at its time of release without any
                        major video/radio airplay, making it the band's first record to be certified Gold by the
                        RIAA.

According to Allmusic's Steve Huey,
                        Master of Puppets "was the band's greatest achievement." "Some critics have
                        called Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album ever recorded", Huey noted. Master of
                        Puppets has featured on several "greatest albums of
                        all time" lists. The album is present in a list dubbed "The All-TIME 100 Albums"
                        and published by TIME magazine in November 2006. In TIME critic Josh Tyrangiel's opinion,
                        "Metallica didn't bother with hooks or pop
                        discipline" in writing Master of Puppets. Metal Rules rated the album as being number one
                        in a list of the "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" published in September 2003, whereas IGN
                        also rated the album as being at first position in a list
                        of the "Top 25 Metal Albums" issued in January 2007. It is included in the book 1001
                        Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and Q magazine counted it among the 50 heaviest albums of
                        all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 167 on
                        Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

					<summary>Metallica (also known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by the American heavy
                        metal band Metallica, released August 12, 1991 through Elektra Records. It features some of
                        Metallica's most popular songs, "Enter

					<content>Metallica (also known as The Black Album) is the fifth studio album by the American heavy
                        metal band Metallica, released August 12, 1991 through Elektra Records. It features some of
                        Metallica's most popular songs, "Enter
                        Sandman", "The Unforgiven", "Nothing Else Matters" , "Wherever I
                        May Roam" and "Sad but True". It spent four consecutive weeks at number one on
                        Billboard 200. Metallica is the band's best-selling
                        album to date, with over 15 million copies sold in the United States and over 22 million copies
                        worldwide. It is the best-selling album of the SoundScan era.

The album cover features
                        only the band's logo, angled against the upper left
                        corner, and a coiled snake (derived from the Gadsden flag) on the bottom right corner, both in a
                        dark shade of gray in order to be made out against the black background. The motto of the
                        Gadsden flag, "Don't Tread on Me", is also the
                        title of a song featured on the album.

The cover is very reminiscent of Spinal Tap's
                        Smell the Glove album, something the band jokingly acknowledged themselves in their A Year and a
                        Half in the Life of Metallica documentary (where
                        members of Spinal Tap appeared and asked them about it).

Metallica DVD-Audio 5.1 mix
                        was released in 2004 through Elektra Records.

While the album and the band were
                        critically praised and commercially successful, some fans expressed
                        disappointment in the new direction taken by Metallica. Gone for the most part were faster
                        staccato riffs during verses and throaty vocals found on the band's first four albums; the
                        overall speed and complexity of the music was somewhat
                        lessened. The Black Album presented a more radio-friendly, commercially accessible Metallica,
                        especially evidenced by the ballad "Nothing Else Matters". Moreover, following the
                        success of "One," the breakaway single from their
                        …And Justice for All album, five videos were released from The Black Album. ("Enter Sandman",
                        "Nothing Else Matters", "Sad but True", "Wherever I May Roam" and
                        "The Unforgiven").

The lyrics
                        of The Black Album, written by James Hetfield, were much more personal and introspective in
                        nature than previous Metallica albums. For example, "The God That Failed" dealt with
                        Hetfield's mother's death from cancer and her
                        Christian Science beliefs which kept her from seeking medical treatment. "Nothing Else
                        Matters" expresses the connection Hetfield felt with a girlfriend while out on the road.
                        The album ended Metallica's tradition of including a
                        lengthy instrumental track on each album until their 2008 album Death Magnetic.

                        destined to become hard-rock classics....[They] effectively bridg[e] the gap between commercial
                        metal and the much harder thrash of Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth." In 2003, the album was
                        ranked number 252 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of
                        the 500 greatest albums of all time.

                        Magazine's "90 Greatest Albums of the '90s" - Spin (p.89) - "This
                        record's diamond-tipped tuneage stripped the band's
                        melancholy guitar excess down to melodic, radio-ready bullets and ballads."

 *
                        Entertainment Weekly (8/16/91) - "Rock's preeminent speed-metal cyclone...Metallica
                        may have invented a new genre: progressive thrash." -
                        Rating: B+

 * Q magazine (8/00, p.127) - Included in Q's "Best Metal Albums
                        of All Time" - "Transformed them from cult metal heroes into global
                        superstars....bringing a little refinement to their undoubted
                        power."

 * Melody Maker (12/91) - Ranked #16 in Melody Maker's list of the
                        top 30 albums of 1991 - "In a committed move away from their thrash roots, Metallica was
                        slower, less complicated, and probably twice as heavy as
                        anything they'd done before."


Metallica was produced by Bob Rock, who
                        was originally asked to mix the album as the band was impressed with his work as producer on the
                        Mötley Crüe album, Dr. Feelgood. Initially, the band was
                        not interested in having Rock produce their album, but changed their minds as Ulrich stated;
                        "We felt that we still had our best record in us and Bob [Rock] could help us make it."
                        The Black Album's sound was a marked difference from
                        the stripped down production of the previous album. Rock altered the band's working
                        schedule and routine so much that they swore never to work with him again. The animosity and
                        tension between band and producer was documented in the
                        documentaries A Year And A Half In The Life of Metallica and Classic Albums: The Black Album.
                        Both explore and document the intense and merciless recording process that resulted in The Black
                        Album.

Despite the controversies between the band
                        and Rock, he continued to work with the band up until, and including, the 2003 album St. Anger.

The
                        world tour following the Metallica album, initially dubbed the "Wherever We May Roam Tour"
                        and then later the "Nowhere Else To
                        Roam Tour", saw Metallica on the road for the next three years. The tour was in part
                        documented in the A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica documentary, as well as the 3-CD,
                        2-DVD (or 3-VHS) boxset Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge. &lt;a

					<summary>ReLoad is the seventh album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released November 18,
                        1997. The album is a direct sequel or counterpart to the band's previous album, Load.
                        Drummer Lars Ulrich stated that: "it's the second
                        half of Load. It's just coming out a year-and-a-half later." To date, the album has
                        sold over 4 million copies in the US, and is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 100,000
                        copies.

                        time, the band decided that half of the songs were to be released, and the band would continue
                        to work on the remaining songs and release them the
                        following year. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Reload"&gt;Read more on

Ride the Lightning is often hailed by fans as
                        a classic of the thrash metal genre and a vital bridge between the band's albums Kill
                        'Em All and Master of Puppets, pushing the thrash metal
                        of the debut into progressive territory more fully-realized on "Master of Puppets" and
                        "...And Justice for All."

Ride the Lightning retains the speed of Kill 'Em
                        All on songs like "Trapped Under Ice" and
                        "Fight Fire with Fire", but also contains the first of Metallica's longer, more
                        intricate tracks, such as "Fade to Black" and the nearly 9-minute closing instrumental
                        "The Call of Ktulu". "Ride the
                        Lightning" is the last Metallica album to credit Dave Mustaine.

Ride the Lightning
                        was listed at #3 on a list compiled by metal-rules.com of the Top 100 Metal Albums of All Time
                        and #5 by IGN Music on the Top 25 Metal Albums. &lt;a

				<content>Metallica is an American metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, United States when drummer Lars Ulrich posted an advertisement in The Recycler. Metallica’s line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist
        James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several
        bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003.

Metallica’s early releases included fast tempos,
        instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the “big four” of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim,
        with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and “heavy” metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the
        band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience.

In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band’s copyright-protected material for
        free without the band members’ consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the
        “steel-sounding” snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.

Metallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty-two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has
        won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band’s 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million
        copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth
        highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone.

Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica
        organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band.

On June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu,
        was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind's "Lulu" plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora's Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times,
        with Lars Ulrich later stating Lou Reed challenged him to a "street fight". On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating, "The writing process for the new
        Metallica album has begun. We've been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we're going to be recording during the most of next year."

				<content>Arcade Fire is an indie rock band formed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2001. The band consists of Win Butler (vocals, guitar, piano), Régine Chassagne (vocals, accordion, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, drums), Richard Reed Parry (bass, guitar),
        Will Butler (keyboards, guitar), Tim Kingsbury (bass), and Jeremy Gara (drums). Montreal percussionist Dane Mills performed on the EP and in early live shows. As of May 2005, the touring band includes horn players and violinists.

The band’s
        trademark fashion consists in wearing rather formal attire during live events and a use of orchestral instruments. When asked about the rumour that the band's name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: "It's not a rumour,
        it's based on a story that someone told me. It's not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it's probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him." Win Butler and his brother Will
        grew up in Texas.

Band formation

Arcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Régine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003/early 2004, when their
        first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more
        prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass,
        xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide
        set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent
        record label Merge Records.

Funeral

Without a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9.7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory
        of Funeral and it became the label's first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the
        band's expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005's best albums and "Rebellion (Lies)"
        the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed
        Neutral Milk Hotel's In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date.

Arcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine's Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who "helped
        put Canadian music on the world map". On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: "Wake Up", "Rebellion (Lies)" and "Neighborhood #3
        (Power Out)". Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio. 

Neon Bible

In
        mid-December 2006 www.neonbible.com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention. Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features
        including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. 

Then in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made
        with a video in the album's website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry's own face, and sitting on Win Butler´s chair. After the announcement of the album´s release, the website was updated with a
        streaming version of "Black Mirror", new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band´s members.

The Suburbs

The band released their third album "The Suburbs" on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010
        in the United States. It debuted at #1 in both countries. On February 13, 2011, the album won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards.

Arcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12
        and Beyond), called "Abraham's Daughter". The song is featured in the movie's end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first
        week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It's the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson's "This Is It" debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the
        history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts).

Reflektor

Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December
        2012, the band's manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website sets the release date on October 28, 2013. The band announced on January
        18, 2013 that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios - including Murphy's DFA Records studio in New York. On June
        22, 2013, Rolling Stone reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013.

Everything Now

Arcade Fire's first announced its fifth record, "Everything Now," on May 31, 2017 when it
        released the record's title track and lead single. The album's release came July 27, 2017. In the weeks leading up to the album's release, the band released three additional lead singles, "Creature Comfort," "Signs of
        Life," and "Electric Blue." Upon the week of its release, "Everything Now" reached #1 on the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the band's third-straight and third overall #1 record. &lt;a

                        multi-platinum certification in Canada, single-platinum certifications in Australia and Sweden,
                        and gold certifications in Mexico, Spain, and the United
                        Kingdom. As of April 2016, the album managed to sell 9.8 millions copies worldwide.

"Nobody's
                        Perfect" was released as the only single from Hannah Montana 2 on May 15, 2007. The track
                        peaked at number 27 on the U.S. Billboard
                        Hot 100. "See You Again" was later released as the lead single from Meet Miley Cyrus.

                        top ten on the chart. Its follow-up single "Start All
                        Over" peaked at number 68 in the United States. The soundtrack was further promoted with

                        clothing line were released together - three days earlier than was intended. The EP features the
                        smash hit "Party in the U.S.A.," which peaked at
                        number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the second single, "When I Look At You,"
                        which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles. The track is from the film, The Last
                        Song, which Miley stared in. The album debuted on the
                        Billboard 200 albums at number two 63,729 copies sold. Colbie Caillat kept her from debuting at
                        number one with only three days of sales. The next week, it stayed at number two with 161,604
                        copies sold. It would've been higher if it not had been
                        released earlier. Instead, Whitney Houston debuted at number one with sales almost twice as much
                        as Cyrus. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/The+Time+of+Our+Lives"&gt;Read

				<content>Miley Ray Cyrus (born Destiny Hope Cyrus; November 23, 1992 in Nashville, Tennessee, United States) is an American actress and pop singer. She gained fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah
        Montana, which began in 2006 and ended in 2010. Cyrus recorded music for the soundtracks Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records, which helped establish her as a teen idol. In 2007, Cyrus
        signed to Hollywood Records for a solo career. She went on the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year; the tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film entitled Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert
        (2008).
In April 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which experienced international success and she was included in Time magazine's 2008 Top 100. She began her foray into films by providing the voice of
        "Penny" in the animated film Bolt (2008) and by reprising the role of Miley in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). Bolt's theme song, "I Thought I Lost You", earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original
        Song. Hannah Montana: The Movie' soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets.
She began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), an extended play which
        presented a more mainstream pop sound, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus's best-selling single, "Party in the U.S.A." (2009). Cyrus ranked number twenty-nine on Forbes' 2009
        Celebrity 100. An upcoming studio album titled Can't Be Tamed will be released in 2010 and presents a new dance-pop sound. The music video and lyrics of the album's lead single, "Can't Be Tamed", portrays a more sexualized
        image for the entertainer. Cyrus has stated that she intends to focus on acting rather than singing in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available

					<content>Bad is the seventh album by Michael Jackson. It was released on August 31, 1987 by Epic/CBS
                        Records. The record was released nearly five years after his last studio album Thriller. 20
                        years after its release, the album has sold over 30
                        million copies worldwide, and shipped 8 million units in the United States. Bad is the first,
                        and currently only album ever to feature five Billboard Hot 100 #1 singles.

Jackson
                        began recording demos for the anticipated follow-up to Thriller
                        a few months after his last performance with The Jacksons after their successful Victory Tour.
                        Recording took place between November 1986 and July 9, 1987 (except for "Another Part of Me"
                        which was recorded for Captain EO in 1986). Jackson
                        wrote a reported sixty songs for the new album and recorded thirty, wanting to use them all on a
                        three-disc set. Instead his longtime producer Quincy Jones cut it down to ten tracks and a bonus
                        song making it a single LP. The CD release contained the
                        bonus track, "Leave Me Alone". Jackson wrote nine of the eleven tracks himself while
                        Terry Britten (writer of Tina Turner's "What's Love Got to Do With It") and
                        Graham Lyle wrote "Just Good Friends" and Siedah
                        Garrett and Glen Ballard wrote "Man in the Mirror". Contributions from other musicians
                        included Stevie Wonder who sung a duet with Jackson on "Just Good Friends" while Steve
                        Stevens contributed a guitar solo for "Dirty
                        Diana". Originally Jones wanted "Bad" to have been a duet between Jackson and
                        Prince; but apparently, Prince told him that the song "would be a hit without (him) on it".
                        Years later, Prince (jokingly) explained his reason for
                        declining was over either artist singing the song's "your butt is mine" lyric.
                        Another song, "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", was also supposed to feature a
                        famous female singer. Reportedly Barbra Streisand, Aretha
                        Franklin and Whitney Houston all turned down the duet offer. R&amp;B singer-songwriter Siedah
                        Garrett was picked by Quincy Jones to sing with him on the song. According to Jones, song
                        choices were difficult. For instance: he and Jackson deliberated
                        over two MJ compositions intended for the album. One: "Streetwalker" favoured by the
                        artist, and Jones' choice: "Another Part of Me". Jones said the dilemma was
                        decided by Jackson's portly manager Frank DiLeo
                        "shaking his butt" to "Another Part of Me". Jones joked: Jackson verbally
                        chastised DiLeo, who he nicknamed "Rubba", for it.

By the time Jackson
                        released this album, sales of its predecessor, Thriller, had
                        already reached forty million, raising expectations for Bad. Bad became the first of Jackson's
                        albums to debut at number-one on the Billboard 200 where it remained for the next six
                        consecutive weeks. The RIAA certified Bad for having sold eight
                        million copies in the U.S. alone. In the U.K, the album sold 500,000 copies in just five days
                        and is currently certified 13x platinum, for sales of 3.9 million making it Jackson's
                        biggest-selling album in the UK. Globally, it's
                        Jackson's overall third best-selling recording, behind "Thriller" and "Dangerous",
                        with 30 million copies sold.

Jackson set another record with this album, becoming the
                        first - and currently, only artist to have five
                        songs to hit number-one from one album. In July 2006, it was announced by the The Official UK
                        Charts Company that Bad was the ninth biggest selling album in British history. It turned out to
                        be the last collaborative effort by Jackson and Jones, as
                        Jackson moved on to write and produce more of his own records, particularly with Teddy Riley,
                        Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis and Rodney Jerkins.

Rolling Stone stated that "even
                        without a milestone recording like "Billie Jean", Bad
                        is still a better record than Thriller." The magazine further went on to say that the
                        "filler" content in Bad - including songs such as "Speed Demon", "Dirty
                        Diana" and "Liberian Girl" - is written by
                        Jackson himself, making Bad "richer, sexier and better than Thriller's forgettables."

Despite
                        the records success, in a poll of 23,000 US citizens, released by Rolling Stone, Jackson won
                        "worst album" for Bad and
                        "worst single" for "Bad". TIME gave the opinion that the singer was
                        suffering a backlash in certain parts of the US. The publication suggested that the singer's
                        media image was triggering the poll, not the music.

In
                        2001, a special edition was released with three new songs and a new booklet containing lyrics
                        and never-before-seen photos.

In 2003, the album was ranked number 202 on Rolling Stone
                        magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all
                        time. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Bad"&gt;Read more on

					<content>Off the Wall is the fifth studio album by the American recording artist Michael Jackson,
                        released August 10, 1979 on Epic Records, after Jackson's critically well received film
                        performance in The Wiz. While working on that project,
                        Jackson and Quincy Jones had become friends, and Jones agreed to work with Jackson on his next
                        studio album. Recording sessions took place between December 1978 and June 1979 at Allen Zentz
                        Recording, Westlake Recording Studios, and Cherokee Studios
                        in Los Angeles, California. Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers
                        such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the
                        album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson
                        wrote several of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, "Don't
                        Stop 'til You Get Enough". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label
                        he would record on until his death in
                        2009.

The record was a departure from Jackson's previous work for Motown. Several
                        critics observed that Off the Wall was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soft rock, jazz and pop
                        ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal
                        performance on the record. The record gained positive reviews and won the singer his first
                        Grammy Award since the early 1970s. With Off the Wall, Jackson became the first solo artist to
                        have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of
                        the Billboard Hot 100. The album was a commercial success; to date it is certified for 8×
                        Multi-Platinum in the US and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of
                        the best selling albums of all time.

On October 16, 2001,
                        a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records. Recent reviews by
                        Allmusic and Blender have continued to praise Off the Wall for its appeal in the 21st century.
                        In 2003, the album was ranked number 68 on Rolling Stone
                        magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The National Association of
                        Recording Merchandisers listed it at number 80 of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. In
                        2008, Off the Wall was inducted into the Grammy Hall of
                        Fame.

					<content>Thriller is the best selling album of all time. It is the sixth studio album by American
                        recording artist Michael Jackson. The album was released on November 30, 1982 by Epic Records as
                        the follow-up to Jackson's critically and

                        Off The Wall, including funk, disco, soul, soft rock, jazz and pop. However, Thriller's
                        lyrics deal with generally darker themes, including paranoia
                        and the supernatural.

With a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took
                        place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California.
                        Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of
                        Thriller's nine tracks. Following the release of the album's first single "The
                        Girl Is Mine", some observers assumed Thriller would only be a minor hit record. With the
                        release of the second single "Billie Jean", the
                        album topped the charts in many countries. It reached number one in the United States and the
                        United Kingdom simultaneously, becoming the first album to do so. At its peak, the album was
                        selling a million copies a week worldwide. In just over a year,
                        Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. Sales are estimated to be over 110 million
                        copies sold worldwide as of March 2010. Seven of the album's nine songs were released as
                        singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100.
                        The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Despite numerous
                        five-star reviews, Thriller was not universally praised.

Thriller cemented Jackson as
                        one of the predominant pop stars of the late 20th century, and
                        enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President
                        Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was the first to use music videos as successful
                        promotional tools—the videos for Thriller, "Billie
                        Jean" and "Beat It" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special
                        edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo
                        recording and the song "Someone In the Dark", which was
                        a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was
                        reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a
                        previously unreleased song and a DVD.

Thriller ranked number
                        20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed
                        by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in their Definitive 200
                        Albums of All Time. Thriller was preserved by the Library
                        of Congress to the National Recording Registry, as it was deemed "culturally significant".

				<content>Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an
        inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically
        complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others.

Jackson's musical career
        began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the
        Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100
        million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U.S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the
        Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson
        as "the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley". He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music.

From 1988 to 2005,
        Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly
        occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter.
        He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. 

Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan's VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the
        Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown's funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008,
        Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary, a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2.1 million copies sold worldwide.

On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in
        Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London's O2 arena, from July
        13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement.

In the hours following Jackson's death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to
        number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music
        chart. Social music network website Last.fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death.

On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled
        Michael, was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics. This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal, a
        remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25, a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson's 1987 hit album Bad; and by Xscape, a second compilation album released in May 2014.

"I look at life like a
                        carnival. Clowns are supposed to be happy, but they are really scary. Carnivals are supposed to
                        be fun, but really they are kind of creepy. But, we go and
                        we buy cotton candy and we force our laughter and we get on rides and we strap ourselves in and
                        we do it. And that's like life to me, and love. Love is supposed to be fun, but it can
                        sometimes be really scary. And the funhouse mirrors that make

				<content>P!nk is a stylisation of Pink, a pseudonym of singer songwriter Alecia Beth Moore (b. 8 Sep 1979, in Doylestown, PA, USA), who gained prominence in early 2000. She has sold over 16 million albums in the United States, over 43 million
        worldwide, and has won three Grammy awards.

P!nk began her career as an RnB artist, signed to the predominately urban label, LaFace Records. She has since complained that because she chose to relinquish creative control to her record label,
        she did not like the type of music she was making at that time, and did not like her image, which included bright Pink hair. Her first album, Can't Take Me Home was a substantial success, going platinum, due to the huge pop and urban radio hit
        singles "There You Go" and "Most Girls". 

Towards the end of 2001, P!nk decided to take her career in a new direction and have more creative control. Tired of being marketed as a another cookie-cutter pop act, and eager
        to become a more serious singer-songwriter and musician, P!nk sought the help of former 4 Non Blondes vocalist, Linda Perry. Together, P!nk and Perry co-wrote and co-produced most of the tracks on P!nk's sophomore album, M!ssundaztood, which was
        released in November 2001. The album's more pop rock sound could be heard immediately with its first single, the Linda Perry penned "Get the Party Started". "Get the Party Started" was a huge, commercially successful single,
        topping the charts in many countries. The album's other singles, "Don't Let Me Get Me", "Just Like A Pill", and "Family Portrait" were also radio and commercial successes.

In 2003, P!nk released a new
        album called Try This. Eight of the thirteen tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of punk band Rancid. Try This reached the Top 10 on album charts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia in 2003. Though its singles "Trouble" and "God
        Is A DJ" didn't do as well in her home country as her previous singles, "Trouble" earned Pink her second Grammy award in 2003. However the singles were largely successful in the United Kingdom and Australia.

P!nk's
        fourth album, I'm Not Dead was released in April 2006. The first single was the controversial and funny "Stupid Girls". The album had started causing controversy before it was even released: the song Dear Mr. President is an open
        letter condemning the actions of President George W. Bush. P!nk appeared on the Australian TV show "Rove Live", discussing the track, stating that it would never be released as a single in the United States, lest it be misinterpreted as a
        publicity stunt. A DVD containing concert footage of P!nk's Try This European tour was released in May 2006.

Her fifth album, Funhouse, was released in October 2008, preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100,
        "So What". The following singles from Funhouse, "Sober" and "Please Don't Leave Me", both charted well on their releases around the world.

In 2010 P!nk collaborated on The Imagine Project singing Don't
        Give Up and Imagine. She also featured in the track Won't Back Down for Enimem's album Recovery. In October 2010 she released the first single Raise Your Glass from her first compilation album Greatest Hits... So Far!!!.

P!nk was
        the voice actress of Gloria in the animated movie Happy Feet Two, which premiered in the US on November 18, 2011. She also sang the movie's theme song Bridge of Light.

P!nk's sixth album The Truth About Love was first confirmed by
        P!nk by Twitter on February 29, 2012. The first single from this album Blow Me (One Last Kiss) was produced by Greg Kurstin and released on July 3. P!nk announced the album title the following day, along with the news of her upcoming world tour. On
        September 6th P!nk performed Blow Me (One Last Kiss) live at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. In February 2013 P!nk started her "Truth About Love Tour", which was so popular that she added additional dates for US/Canada and
        Australia.

During this time her track Just Give Me A Reason rose up to 9th on the Hot 100, her 14th Top 10 hit on that chart. The following week this rose up to number 5, and two weeks later it topped the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her 4th
        number-one single in the US. It also topped the charts in several other countries worldwide, and held the top spot on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. On April 29, 2013, Just Give Me a Reason became P!nk's eighth number one on
        Billboard's Adult Top 40, which resulted in her becoming the record holder for most number ones on that chart, beating out Maroon 5 and Katy Perry who each have seven.

In 2013, Billboard named Pink Woman of the Year, citing the success
        of her album The Truth About Love and of the singles "Blow Me (One Last Kiss)", "Try", "Just Give Me a Reason", and "True Love", as well as her 2013 tour, which was extended to 140 different sets due to demand.
        The Truth About Love earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album earlier in 2013.

After releasing The Truth About Love in 2012, RCA Records has announced that they have signed Pink for a multi-album deal that will last for years
        to come.

It was announced in September 2014, that Pink and Dallas Green, lead singer of City and Colour, worked together on a collaborative album, under the band name You+Me. The album, titled Rose Ave., was released on October 14, 2014. The
        album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 and at number one on the US Folk Albums chart. In August 2015, Pink recorded the theme song for the 13th season of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The song, "Today's the Day", was performed
        during the show's premiere week in New York City on September 10, 2015.

It was announced in February 2016 that Pink will cover a Beatles song, "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", for the upcoming Netflix original series Beat
        Bugs. In the same month, it was announced that she had recorded a cover of "White Rabbit" for the movie Alice Through the Looking Glass, while in April it was revealed that she contributed the song "Just Like Fire" to the
        soundtrack of the movie. "Just Like Fire" has since peaked at number 10, becoming her first top 10 single since "Just Give Me a Reason" reached number one in April 2013. In July 2016, it was announced that Pink had written a song
        for French-Canadian singer Celine Dion called "Recovering" for inclusion on her upcoming English-language album. Pink provided guest vocals on country singer Kenny Chesney's single Setting the World on Fire which was released on August
        1, 2016. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/P%21nk"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.</content>

					<content>Boxer is the fourth full-length studio album by Brooklyn-via-Cincinnati indie rock band The
                        National. It was released on May 22, 2007 by Beggars Banquet Records. The album features a guest
                        performance by Sufjan Stevens on "Ada" and
                        "Racing Like a Pro" and backing vocals by Marla Hansen. It debuted at number 68 on the
                        U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 9,500 copies in its first week. The song "Slow Show"
                        contains lyrics from the band's song "29
                        Years," first found on their self-titled debut album.

"From the first piano
                        chords on opener "Fake Empire", the National create a late-night, empty-city-street
                        mood, slightly menacing but mostly isolated. The 10 tracks
                        that follow sustain and even amplify that feeling, revealing the band's range as they play
                        close to the vest." So says Pitchfork Media's Steven Deusner, who gave the album an
                        8.6/10.0. The album also received 4 stars from Rolling
                        Stone's Rob Sheffield.

Songs from Boxer have made appearances on television shows
                        such as "Chuck" "The Riches" "One Tree Hill" "Gossip Girl"
                        and President Barack Obama's campaign video
                        "Signs of Hope and Change"

A film by Vincent Moon documenting the creation of
                        the album, entitled "A Skin, a Night" was released on Beggar's Banquet on May 20,
                        2008. &lt;a

					<content>Trouble Will Find Me is the sixth studio album by American indie rock band The National,
                        released on May 17, 2013 on 4AD.
Produced by band members Aaron and Bryce Dessner, the album
                        features appearances from St. Vincent, Sharon Van
                        Etten, Doveman, Sufjan Stevens, Nona Marie Invie, of Dark Dark Dark fame, and Richard Reed
                        Parry, of Arcade Fire.
The album received widespread critical acclaim upon its release.
                        Trouble Will Find Me reached number three on both the Billboard 200
                        and the UK Albums Chart.

The National began writing Trouble Will Find Me towards the
                        end of the band's tour in support of previous album, High Violet (2010). Regarding the tour's
                        completion, and the collective mental state of the
                        band at this time, lead vocalist Matt Berninger noted, "[We] felt satisfied at the end of
                        touring High Violet. It was the first time ever, or at least in the past ten years, where we
                        felt like we could put the band on the shelf for a little
                        while, put a record out in three, four years. There wasn’t any sense of, 'what now?'"
Berninger,
                        however, became inspired by guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner's recent demo recordings,
                        and subsequently completed his writing
                        contributions to the album's opening track, "I Should Live in Salt", a day after
                        initially hearing it. Bass guitarist Scott Devendorf noted, "Our typical way of working was
                        to send stuff to Matt, then wait a while to get some
                        mumbles back. He seemed really motivated and engaged with the new stuff."

The band
                        began recording Trouble Will Find Me in late September 2012, at a converted barn in Rhinebeck,
                        New York, named Clubhouse. Bass guitarist Scott Devendorf
                        stated that Clubhouse was chosen primarily to establish camaraderie amongst the band, noting:
                        "The impetus to record upstate-- cooking, eating, working, hanging out together - was to
                        achieve this music-camp feel." The first four days of
                        recording were interrupted by a tornado which subsequently led to a power cut. Guitarist,
                        keyboardist and co-producer Aaron Dessner noted, "That night, by candlelight in the total
                        darkness, we got really drunk and played the songs acoustically.
                        It was the kind of scene that has never happened in the history of our band — and will never
                        happen again."
The band subsequently relocated to Dreamland Studios - located within a
                        converted 19th century church, in West Hurley, New York - to
                        record the track, "Fireproof", entirely live. Inspired by the session, the band
                        returned to Clubhouse and recorded both "Sea of Love" and "Heavenfaced" as
                        one-take live performances. Recording at Clubhouse, however, was
                        once again derailed by Hurricane Sandy, with Aaron Dessner stating, "I drove back into the
                        city because I was worried about my family and the potential flooding, and got stuck there for
                        four days.''
Dessner, who co-produced Trouble
                        Will Find Me alongside his brother Bryce, noted that his experiences producing both Sharon Van
                        Etten's Tramp (2012) and Local Natives' Hummingbird (2013) led him to understand the
                        importance of "constructive, positive dialogue" in
                        the recording studio, whereas before he and his bandmates would often argue throughout the
                        process.

Inspired by the recent birth of his daughter, Ingrid Stella Dessner,
                        guitarist, keyboardist and co-producer Aaron Dessner began writing music
                        with his child in mind. Vocalist Matt Berninger noted that he "react[ed] to it in a very
                        visceral, immediate, infantile way."
The lyrics to the album's opening track,
                        "I Should Live in Salt", are directed towards Matt
                        Berninger's brother, Tom, who directed the forthcoming band documentary, Mistaken for
                        Strangers (2013). Berninger stated that he enjoyed the writing process for Trouble Will Find Me
                        noting, "In the past, it’s been hard to enjoy writing -
                        like getting drops of blood from your forehead - but I loved the process for this record. I
                        think a lot of it was because I wasn't worried - I didn't care what the songs were
                        going to be about, or if they were going to seem depressing, or
                        cool, or whatever." &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+National/Trouble+Will+Find+Me"&gt;Read

				<content>The National is a Brooklyn-based alternative rock band formed in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The band's lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of
        two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). 

Their self-titled debut album"The National" (Brassland 2001) was recorded and
        released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it "the stuff
        underground legends are made of."

The National made a second album, "Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers" (Brassland/Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced "Turn on The Bright Lights" and
        "Antics" by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings.

Following the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France's Radio Inter, an
        in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song's standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger
        Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet.

A show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own
        path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, "Alligator", much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was
        engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport,
        Connecticut.

Berninger's potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record's not simply gothic or miserablist -- more
        like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it's full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator's heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National's imaginings, in songs alternately lush and
        spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains.

"Abel," "Secret Meeting," and "Lit Up" were released as singles.

On May 22, 2007, The National released their
        follow-up to Alligator, Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping
        the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road.

"Mistaken for
        Strangers", "Fake Empire" and "Apartment Story" have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large
        festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007.

The band's fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. "Bloodbuzz Ohio", "Anyone's Ghost" and
        "Terrible Love" were released as singles.

					<content>21st Century Breakdown is the eighth studio album by American punk rock band Green Day,
                        released through Reprise Records on May 15, 2009. It is the band's second rock opera,
                        following American Idiot, and its first album to be produced
                        by Butch Vig. Vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong described 21st Century Breakdown as a
                        "snapshot of the era in which we live as we question and try to make sense of the selfish
                        manipulation going on around us, whether it be the
                        government, religion, media or frankly any form of authority.
The span of nearly five years
                        between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in
                        Green Day's career. The band had been working on new
                        material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band
                        showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when a video of the group recording with
                        producer Butch Vig in the studio was posted on YouTube. The
                        writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally
                        finished in April 2009.
The album received generally positive reception. 21st Century
                        Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date.
                        Upon its release, 21st Century Breakdown reached number one on the charts of at least fourteen
                        countries. The album subsequently achieved number one on the Billboard 200, European Top 100
                        Albums and UK Albums Charts. &lt;a

					<content>Dookie is the third studio album and the major label debut by American punk rock band Green
                        Day. The album was the band's first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo. Released on
                        February 1, 1994 through Reprise Records, Dookie became
                        a worldwide commercial success, reaching number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 and charting in
                        seven countries. The album helped to propel Green Day into mainstream popularity, amid claims
                        from the punk rock community that the band had "sold
                        out".

Dookie produced five singles for the band: "Longview", the
                        re-recorded "Welcome to Paradise", "Basket Case", the radio-only single
                        "She" and "When I Come Around". As of 2008,
                        Dookie is the band's best-selling album, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide. Dookie
                        won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1995.

Following the
                        underground success of the band's second album Kerplunk
                        (1992), a number of major labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels
                        attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one
                        manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band
                        declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were
                        impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo
                        "was the only person we could really talk to and
                        connect with".

Eventually, the band left their independent record label Lookout!
                        Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing to a major label caused many of the
                        band's original fans from the independent music club 924
                        Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering
                        since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong
                        told Spin magazine in 1999, "I couldn't go back to
                        the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure The only
                        thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward."

Rob Cavallo was chosen as the
                        main producer of the album, with Jerry Finn as the
                        mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it
                        during the car ride home he sensed that "had stumbled on something big." The band's
                        recording session lasted three weeks and the album was
                        remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, "Similar to
                        the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." The band felt the original mix
                        to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed, at
                        Fantasy Studios in Berkeley California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, "Everything
                        was already written, all we had to do was play it."

Much of the album's
                        content was written by Armstrong, except
                        "Emenius Sleepus" which was co-written by Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt, and the
                        hidden track, "All By Myself", which was composed and written by drummer Tré Cool. The
                        album touched upon various experiences of the band members
                        and included subjects like anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom,
                        and former girlfriends.

The single "Longview" had a signature bass line that
                        bass player Dirnt wrote while under the influence of LSD.
                        He originally forgot much of it, but the remembered portions were included in the song.
                        Armstrong stated that the song was mainly about boredom, masturbation, and smoking cannabis, as
                        evident in some of the lyrics ("When masturbation's lost
                        its fun/You're fucking breaking").


"Welcome to Paradise", the
                        second single from Dookie, was originally on the second studio album by the band, Kerplunk. The
                        song was re-recorded, with a less grainy sound for Dookie.
                        The song never had an official music video, however, a certain live performance of the song is
                        often associated as a music video. The video is located on Green Day's official website.

The
                        radio-only single, "She", was written
                        by Armstrong about a former girlfriend who showed him a feminist poem with an identical title.
                        In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of "She" and showed them to her. She later moved
                        to Ecuador, prompting Armstrong to put "She" on
                        the album. The same ex-girlfriend is the topic of the songs "Sassafras Roots" and
                        "Chump".

Another song, "Coming Clean", deals with Armstrong's
                        coming to terms with his bisexuality when he was 16 and 17
                        years old. In his interview with The Advocate magazine, he says that although he has never had a
                        relationship with a man, his sexuality has been "something that comes up as a struggle in
                        me".

The hit single "Basket Case",
                        which appeared on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal
                        experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks and feelings of "going
                        crazy" prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder.
                        The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution.

The final single, "When
                        I Come Around", was again inspired by a woman, though this time being about Armstrong's
                        wife, then former girlfriend, Adrienne. Following a
                        dispute between the couple, Armstrong left Adrienne to spend some time alone. The video featured
                        the three band members walking around Berkeley and San Francisco at night, eventually ending up
                        back at the original location. Future touring back up
                        guitarist, Jason White, made a cameo in the video with his then-girlfriend.

Billie Joe
                        Armstrong wrote the song "In The End" about his mother and her boyfriend (similar to
                        Why Do You Want Him). He is quoted saying: "That song
                        is about my mother's husband, it's not really about a girl, or like anyone directly
                        related to me in a relationship. In the End's about my mother."

[edit] Album
                        name and art

The name of the album is a reference
                        to the band members often suffering from diarrhea, which they referred to as "liquid dookie",
                        as a result of eating spoiled food whilst on tour. Initially the band were to name the album
                        "Liquid Dookie", however this was deemed
                        "too gross", and so they settled on the name "Dookie".

The cover
                        art is an illustration by Richie Bucher, which depicts bombs being dropped on people and
                        buildings. In the center, there is an explosion, with the
                        band's name at the top. Armstrong has since explained the meaning of the artwork:
“ I
                        wanted the art work to look really different. I wanted it to represent the East Bay and where we
                        come from, because there's a lot of artists in the
                        East Bay scene that are just as important as the music. So we talked to Richie Bucher. He did a
                        7-inch cover for this band called Raooul that I really liked. He's also been playing in
                        bands in the East Bay for years. There's pieces of us
                        buried on the album cover. There's one guy with his camera up in the air taking a picture
                        with a beard. He took pictures of bands every weekend at Gilman's. The robed character that
                        looks like Ozzy Osbourne is the woman on the cover of the
                        first Ozzy album. Angus Young is in there somewhere too. The graffiti reading "Twisted Dog
                        Sisters" refers to these two girls from Berkeley. I think the guy saying "The fritter,
                        fat boy" was a reference to a local cop.
                        ”

The back cover on early prints of the CD featured a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame
                        Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation. Some rumors suggest
                        that it was removed because it led parents to think that Dookie
                        was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.

Upon
                        its release, Dookie charted in seven countries. The album peaked at number two on Billboard 200
                        in the United States, and was a success in
                        several other countries, peaking as high as number one in New Zealand; the lowest peak in any
                        country was in the United Kingdom at number 13. While all the singles from the album charted in
                        a few countries, the hit single "Basket Case"
                        entered the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Later in 1995, the album received a Grammy
                        Award for Best Alternative Music Album, with "Longview" and "Basket Case"
                        both being nominated for a Grammy.

Throughout the
                        1990s, Dookie continued to sell well, eventually receiving diamond certification in 1999; To
                        date, Dookie has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and remains the band's best-selling
                        album.

On April 18, 2009 Dookie was reissued on 180
                        gram vinyl for the 2nd annual 'Record Store Day'.

The album was well received
                        by some critics, with Allmusic describing Dookie as "a stellar piece of modern punk that
                        many tried to emulate but nobody bettered". In 1994,
                        Time claimed Dookie as the third best album of the year, but the best rock album of 1994. The
                        New York Times, in early 1995, described the sound of Dookie as, "Punk turns into pop in
                        fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and
                        channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate."

However, many other
                        music critics, and even some other mainstream bands, claimed the band had sold out for signing
                        to a major label, and called them "watered down punk
                        imposters". The New York Times, while complementary on the album's overall quality,
                        noted that Dookie's pop sound only remotely resembled punk music. The band did not respond
                        initially to these comments, but later claimed that they
                        were "just trying to be themselves" and that "it's our band, we can do
                        whatever we want". Dirnt claimed that the follow up album, Insomniac, one of the band's
                        hardest albums lyrically and musically, was the band
                        releasing their anger at all the criticism from critics and former fans.

Since its
                        release, Dookie has featured heavily in various "must have" lists compiled by the
                        music media. Some of the more prominent of these lists to feature
                        Dookie are shown below; this information is adapted from Acclaimed Music.

					<summary>Insomniac is the fourth studio album from the punk rock band Green Day. It was released on
                        October 10, 1995, through the Reprise Records label. Though it reached number two in the United
                        States and went double Platinum (According to the
                        RIAA) by 1996, Insomniac did not have the sales endurance of its predecessor, Dookie, largely
                        due to its slightly darker lyrical tone and heavier, more abrasive sound. The album is the band's
                        third-best selling album behind Dookie and American
                        Idiot with over 7 million copies sold worldwide. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Insomniac"&gt;Read

					<content>Insomniac is the fourth studio album from the punk rock band Green Day. It was released on
                        October 10, 1995, through the Reprise Records label. Though it reached number two in the United
                        States and went double Platinum (According to the
                        RIAA) by 1996, Insomniac did not have the sales endurance of its predecessor, Dookie, largely
                        due to its slightly darker lyrical tone and heavier, more abrasive sound. The album is the band's
                        third-best selling album behind Dookie and American
                        Idiot with over 7 million copies sold worldwide.
n 1995, a new single for the Angus
                        soundtrack was released, titled "J.A.R.". The single went straight to number one on
                        the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by
                        Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac opened to a warm critical
                        reception, earning four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which said "In punk, the good
                        stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without
                        sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff
                        gets."

Before the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the
                        album Tight Wad Hill (After the thirteenth track of the album)
                        After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him
                        how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered, "It's
                        easy for me. I am an insomniac."
The collage on
                        the album cover was created by Winston Smith and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a
                        reference to the Dead Kennedys song "I Kill Children". Interestingly enough, the cover
                        art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used
                        in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery
                        Disasters. Smith knew Tré Cool from Green Day's time at Lookout! Records and told Tré that
                        if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him. The
                        cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, 3 fairies, and several other ghostly
                        faces in the flames. There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back; one for
                        each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires you to
                        view the piece at an angle. The hidden skull is taken from Hans Holbein's 1533 painting
                        'The Ambassadors'. Green Day's version, however, is slightly different from the
                        original, with the woman holding Billie Joe's sky blue
                        Fernandes imitation Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Insomniac"&gt;Read

					<summary>Following the cool reception to Insomniac, Green Day retreated from the spotlight for a
                        year to rest and spend time with their families. During that extended break, they decided to not

                        make an album according to their instincts, which meant more experimentation and less of their

					<content>Following the cool reception to Insomniac, Green Day retreated from the spotlight for a
                        year to rest and spend time with their families. During that extended break, they decided to not
                        worry about their supposedly lost street credibility and
                        make an album according to their instincts, which meant more experimentation and less of their
                        trademark punk-pop. Of course, speedy, catchy punk is at the core of the group's sound, so
                        there are plenty of familiar moments on the resultant
                        album, Nimrod, but there are also new details that make the record an invigorating, if
                        occasionally frustrating, listen. Although punk-pop is Green Day's forte, they sound the
                        most alive on Nimrod when they're breaking away from their
                        formula, whether it's the shuffling "Hitchin' a Ride," the bitchy,
                        tongue-in-cheek humor of "The Grouch," the surging surf instrumental "Last Ride
                        In," the punchy, horn-driven drag-queen saga "King for a
                        Day," or the acoustic, string-laced ballad "Good Riddance." It's only when
                        the trio confines itself to three chords that it sounds tired, but Billie Joe has such a gift
                        for hooky, instantly memorable melodies that even these
                        moments are enjoyable, if unremarkable. Still, Nimrod suffers from being simply too much --
                        although it clocks in at under 50 minutes, the 18 tracks whip by at such a breakneck speed that
                        it leaves you somewhat dazed. With a little editing, Green
                        Day's growth would have been put in sharper relief, and Nimrod would have been the
                        triumphant leap forward it set out to be. As it stands, it's a muddled but intermittently
                        exciting record that is full of promise. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine,

				<content>Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1986. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tré Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who
        became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1992).

Green Day
        was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band's early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise
        Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream
        interest in punk rock in the United States.

Green Day's three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and
        Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band's rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band's popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band's
        eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band's best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! released in September,
        November and December 2012 respectively.

They are one of the world's best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for
        Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for "Boulevard of Broken Dreams", Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast
        Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked
        number 91 in the VH1 list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".

In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on
        October 17, 1987 at Rod's Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as "Al Sobrante". As said in the film Punk's Not
        Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band.

In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play
        an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion
        with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana.

Lookout! would release Green Day's debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays
        later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed
        Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band's first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band's first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tré Cool
        began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool's position as Green Day's drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band's second studio
        album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U.S.

Kerplunk's underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after
        attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo "was the only person we could really talk to and connect with". Reflecting on the
        period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, "I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure ... The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward." After
        signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie.


Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the
        songs "Longview", "Basket Case", and "When I Come Around", all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem
        broke-out during the band's set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock '94, where they started an
        infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green
        Day's growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the
        Year.

In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled "J.A.R.". The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band's fourth studio album,
        Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band's newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars
        from Rolling Stone, which said "In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets." The singles released from
        Insomniac were "Geek Stink Breath", "Stuck with Me", "Brain Stew/Jaded", and "Walking Contradiction".

Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United
        States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for "Walking Contradiction" got the band a Grammy
        nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion.

After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began
        to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band's standard pop-punk brand of music. The
        new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" won the band an MTV
        Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second "clip show" episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER.

The other singles released from Nimrod were "Nice Guys Finish Last",
        "Hitchin' a Ride" and "Redundant". The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled "The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg", which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day
        embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, the guitarist Jason White began supporting the band on the concerts as rhythm guitarist.

In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band
        participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics' reviews of the album were varied. Allmusic gave it 4.5/5 saying "Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but
        it's tremendously satisfying." Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying "Warning... invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core's
        biggest-selling band?" Though it produced the hit "Minority" and a smaller hit with "Warning", some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all
        of Green Day's previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified platinum.

At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won
        the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist.

The release of two
        compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band's b-sides, including
        "Espionage", which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.

In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with
        Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys.

In the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20
        tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band's best work.
        It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong's record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network
        was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands' sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two
        bands.

Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of "I Fought the Law" made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl
        XXXVIII.



The resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band's first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album's first single, "American
        Idiot". The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious "Jesus of Suburbia". The album depicts the modern American life under the control from an idiot ruler who let people be misinformed by media
        as well as inserted "redneck agenda". It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders on the topic. Released two months before U.S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. American Idiot won
        the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer's Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005.

Through 2005, the band toured in
        support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl
        in England, which was voted 'The Best Show On Earth' in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as
        songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in
        Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively.

On August 1, 2005 Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract
        regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands.

On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People's Choice Award as favorite musical group or band.

Green Day engaged in a number of other smaller
        projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area
        venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot's Tavern in Crockett, California.

In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day's forthcoming album.
        The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day's career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45
        songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and
        four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.

21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the
        release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early
        May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010.

Wal-Mart refused to carry the album
        as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, "There's nothing dirty about our record... They
        want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We've never done it before. You feel like you're in 1953 or something."

In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and
        many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an
        expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new
        song by Green Day entitled "When It's Time". In June 2010 the iTunes received the single "When It's Time".

During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock
        Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the
        rest of Green Day's discography.

During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album:
        "We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get [the songs] down in some early form." The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on
        the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song "Cigarettes and Valentines". In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio
        album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will "most likely" be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011.

During the end of 2011, the band played
        several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled
        ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! which would be released in the fall of 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White's induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows
        including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom.

¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012 respectively and
        were met with generally positive reviews. On January 22, 2013 the band announced that ¡Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would
        be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong's run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began
        their 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold, in the United Kingdom. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on their European leg,
        including during Reading Festival 2013 headline show.

Demolicious, a compilation that album contains alternate versions and demos of songs from ¡Uno!, ¡Dos! and ¡Tré! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April
        19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called "State of Shock" and an acoustic version of "Stay the Night", from ¡Uno!.

Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green
        Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong's Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day's guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt
        plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro
        Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons.

In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer
        Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song "The Saints Are Coming", originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians'
        instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster.

In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America's dependency
        on oil.

Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song "Working Class Hero", which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of
        American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes' "Icky Thump". That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show's theme song. Their
        version was released as a single on July 24, 2007.

In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15,
        2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010.

The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the
        show "a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions ... only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as
        anything I’ve seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past." Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely,
        soberly seated".

Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be "visually striking [and] musically adventurous", but noted that "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character
        development". Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day's "massively popular, starkly disenchanted album ... would be the feel-good musical of the season". Time magazine's Richard Zoglin opined that
        the score "is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered [yet] there's enough variety. ... Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative." He concluded that "American Idiot, despite
        its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. ... Still, [it] deserves at least two cheers – for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway." Peter
        Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote "Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won’t know what hit you. American
        Idiot knows no limits—it's a global knockout." The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle
        Awards.

In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat
        Magnarella. He explained in an interview that "[Artists are] basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don't know how to promote it." For Billie Joe Armstrong, "Many of the artists... show their work on the
        street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression."

On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be
        produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day's manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce.

On January 23, 2013, it was announced
        that a documentary showing Armstrong's journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran
        television journalist for CBS News' 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15,
        2013.

The band has generated controversy over whether the band's musical style and major-label status constitutes as "true punk". In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front
        man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented:

"So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn't earn
        their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn't look anything like they do."

Armstrong himself has discussed the group's status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying "Sometimes I think
        we've become totally redundant because we're this big band now, we've made a lot of money – we're not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, 'You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you
        can't take the punk rock out of us.'"

On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, lead vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong stopped while performing Basket Case, because he
        believed their time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R&amp;B artist Usher's performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled "1 Minutes Left", saying "You're
        not gonna give me one fucking minute? You've gotta be fucking kidding me!". He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a "joke". When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while
        bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band's representative apologized for the incident
        on their behalf stating that "Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas" also adding that Armstrong will be
        headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia. However Mike Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Billie Joe meant by his rant

					<content>Don't Believe the Truth is the sixth studio album by Oasis, released on 30 May 2005.
                        It reached #1 in the UK Albums Chart with first week sales of just under 238,000, becoming the
                        9th fastest selling album ever in the UK. The album
                        entered the U.S. charts at #12, with 65,000 albums sold in the first week, the highest any Oasis
                        album has reached there since 1997 with Be Here Now, although its chart stay was brief. Don't
                        Believe the Truth went triple platinum in the U.K. in
                        the first week of 2006, and in the U.S. has gone to sell over 200,000 units. As of June 2008,
                        Don't Believe the Truth has sold over 4 million copies worldwide.

Every member of
                        the band contributed to the writing of tracks for the album,
                        and the album is the first where all duties were divided between the band members. On some of
                        the tracks regular bass player Andy Bell handled guitar, while Gem Archer and Noel Gallagher
                        contributed bass to other songs. Don't Believe the Truth
                        is the first Oasis record to feature the drumming of Zak Starkey, who replaced Oasis'
                        longtime member Alan White.

Liam also had a larger impact on the album by his
                        developing songwriting. Noel has said that this album is his favourite
                        of Oasis' last four, because all members have contributed to it. This, he claims, has given
                        it a different feel to a typically Noel-written Oasis album.

The band embarked on a
                        massive world-wide tour that started off at the London
                        Astoria for their Don't Believe the Truth Tour, visiting 26 countries and playing to 2
                        million people. This resulted in the making of Lord Don't Slow Me Down, a film later
                        released on DVD. &lt;a

                        was released on the 28th February 2000. It received mixed reviews by professionals. This is the

                        of Oasis' founding members, Bonehead and Guigsy. This album lacks the usual optimism, which
                        usually heard in Oasis' songs. It even sometimes has a quite depressing sound, on songs

					<content>Standing on the Shoulder of Giants is the fourth album by the British rock band Oasis. It
                        was released on the 28th February 2000. It received mixed reviews by professionals. This is the

                        like "Where Did It All Go Wrong" and "Sunday
                        Morning Call".
We can, however, consider this album as the most experimental. It has
                        drum loops, backwards guitar, electric sitar and more. Songs like "Go Let It Out" are
                        a departure from the usual Oasis style, while
                        "Fuckin' In The Bushes" is considered to be the Oasis song which is most
                        influenced by older hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin. The album was released on the Big Brother
                        label, the bands own. &lt;a

					<summary>Stop the Clocks is a compilation album by British rock band Oasis, released on 20 November
                        2006. The "retrospective collection" is an 18-track double album with the featured
                        songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not
                        actually include their song Stop The Clocks after which the album is named. It went 4x platinum
                        in the UK with sales better than any album there since Be Here Now.

The album came
                        about due to the end of Oasis' recording contract with

					<content>Stop the Clocks is a compilation album by British rock band Oasis, released on 20 November
                        2006. The "retrospective collection" is an 18-track double album with the featured
                        songs chosen by Noel Gallagher; however, it does not
                        actually include their song Stop The Clocks after which the album is named. It went 4x platinum
                        in the UK with sales better than any album there since Be Here Now.

The album came
                        about due to the end of Oasis' recording contract with
                        Sony BMG Music Entertainment. Noel Gallagher has gone on record before on numerous occasions
                        saying that Oasis wouldn't release a greatest hits album unless the band were about to
                        split up. However, in an interview with news.com.au in December
                        2005, he hinted that Sony were planning to release one anyway, and that despite his misgivings,
                        he would have to get involved with it otherwise it'd be bad. This was clarified in
                        September 2006, when he told the NME that when he made it clear to
                        Sony that the band were not going to re-sign to them, the record label decided to release a
                        greatest hits album. Gallagher then explained that he insisted that it had to be a 'best-of'
                        because he felt a compilation of the best singles,
                        album tracks and b-sides would produce a stronger album than a compilation of singles.

To
                        address some fans' concerns that the release of a greatest hits album was a sign that the
                        band were about to finish, based on some of Noel
                        Gallagher's previous comments, the press release for the album confirmed that they are
                        merely taking "a well earned sabbatical prior to starting work on new material, destined
                        for similar levels of success in the future. As such, this is
                        not a full stop, but merely a time out; a dream set list, and a chance for the world to review
                        the immense contribution that Oasis have made and continue to make to rock 'n' roll."

Gallagher
                        stated in an episode of MTV's
                        Gonzo that the album would be more for future generations, as Gallagher himself became
                        interested in artists such as The Beatles through compilation albums.

To celebrate the
                        release of the album, the band unveiled their first full-length
                        film - Lord Don't Slow Me Down, shot during the Don't Believe the Truth world tour,
                        from May 2005 to March 2006, the film was shown in November 2006 around the world in selected
                        picture houses, theatres and cinemas to winners of fans
                        competitions and the press. It was also broadcasted on Channel 4 in the UK.

The album
                        debuted at number two in the UK charts selling over 50,000 copies in its first day of release
                        and 216,000 in its first week of release, surprisingly not
                        selling enough to knock off the top spot to The Love Album, by the boy-band Westlife. It also
                        debuted at number 89 on the U.S. Billboard 200, starting with 18,000 units sold. It did however
                        enter the Japanese Oricon album charts at number one,
                        selling 87,462 copies in its first week. The album has sold over around 2.5 million copies
                        worldwide(1.2 million alone in the UK).

In Japan, a box set was also released of all
                        their singles to coincide with the album.

Stop the
                        Clocks focuses heavily on the band's most popular albums, Definitely Maybe and (What's
                        the Story) Morning Glory ?, with each contributing five tracks, plus four B-sides (also included
                        on the band's other compilation album The
                        Masterplan) from this era. Only two tracks appear from Don't Believe the Truth, and one
                        track each from Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and Heathen Chemistry, whilst Be Here Now is
                        ignored completely.

When the release of Stop the
                        Clocks was first announced in July 2006, speculation was rife that the unreleased song of the
                        same name would be included on the record as a bonus track. However, Noel Gallagher told fans at
                        a Q&amp;A session that the song was considered for
                        inclusion, but they weren't happy with any of the many versions they have recorded.

Gallagher
                        also confirmed that the title was chosen to sum up what was described in the initial press
                        release as being "merely a time out; a chance
                        for the world to review the immense contribution that Oasis have made and continue to make to
                        rock 'n' roll." Noel Gallagher revealed in an interview in April 2005 that 'Stop
                        the Clocks' was the original title for the
                        band's early recorded material in early 2004, which turned eventually into Don't
                        Believe the Truth.

Gallagher revealed to Billboard that he was approached about
                        including some new songs on the album as well, but that he opted not
                        to "because it takes the focus away from what you're actually trying to say with a
                        retrospective."

Gallagher told the NME in September 2006 that he picked the tracks
                        on the album, and there were about eight songs that
                        "should be on there, but aren't". He explained that his original vision was for a
                        12-track album on one CD, but, after whittling down from an initial 30+ tracks, the
                        track-listing was finalised. He admitted that he's had arguments
                        with people about the tracklisting but that "someone has to pick the tracklisting, and I've
                        picked it and that's the end of it. But that must mean we're pretty good, if people
                        are arguing about what's not on it, it's
                        brilliant!"

During an interview on Radio 1 in October 2006, and later during a
                        question and answer session with The Sun, Liam Gallagher, who got a songwriting credit with his
                        "Songbird", claimed that he was happy with the
                        tracks Noel had selected for the album, although he said that he would have liked "Rockin'
                        Chair" and "D'You Know What I Mean?" to be included. Noel, however, admitted
                        that "D'You Know What I Mean?" was to
                        be included on the album up until the moment it was being mastered, explaining that the length
                        of the song "upset the flow of the album". 

Songs that the band also wanted
                        to be on the track listing were "Cast No Shadow",
                        "Gas Panic!", Whatever and "Little By Little" , although they couldn't
                        fit them in since they felt the record would "drag on" and make it too long, being
                        over the some 18-track idea Noel had planned out. Noel has
                        also said he would have liked to have found a place for "Fade Away", "(It's
                        Good) To Be Free", Let There Be Love" and "Listen Up".

In the
                        special boxed-edition of 'Stop the Clocks' at the end
                        of the 'Lock the Box' interview, when Liam was told 'Whatever' was not on
                        the track-listing he said "Thank fuck for that".

A Japanese special edition,
                        released the following year, has a variety of B-sides
                        scanning the latter years of the Gallaghers output, including "Eyeball Tickler" and
                        "Lets's All Make Believe". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Stop+the+Clocks"&gt;Read

				<content>Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums,
        percussion), who were soon joined by Liam's older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals).

Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in
        1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic.

The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What's the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by
        singles Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson's Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went
        on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry.

In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam
        Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were "done", but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam
        and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.

2. American rock band: Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in
        the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis,
        released on the Cranbus label in 1973.

Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a
        couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young.

Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was
        compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others.

3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow
        Ray from Detroit.

4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin.
        Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988.

In 2000, Sia signed to Sony Music's sub-label Dance Pool and
        released her second studio album, Healing Is Difficult, the following year. Displeased with the promotion of the record, she signed to Go! Beat and released her third studio album, Colour the Small One, in 2004. The project struggled to connect with
        a mainstream audience, and so Sia relocated to New York City in 2005 and began touring across the United States. She released her fourth and fifth studio releases, Some People Have Real Problems and We Are Born, in 2008 and 2010, respectively. She
        then took a hiatus from performing, during which she focused on songwriting for other artists. Her catalogue includes the successful collaborations "Titanium" (with David Guetta), "Diamonds" (with Rihanna) and "Wild
        Ones" (with Flo Rida).

In 2014, Sia released her sixth studio album 1000 Forms of Fear, which debuted at No 1 in the U.S. Billboard 200 and generated the top-ten breakthrough single "Chandelier" and a trilogy of music videos
        starring child dancer Maddie Ziegler. In 2016, she released her seventh studio album This Is Acting, which spawned her first Hot 100 number one single, "Cheap Thrills". The same year, Sia gave her Nostalgic for the Present Tour, which
        incorporated performance art elements. Sia has received an array of accolades, including ARIA Awards and an MTV Video Music Award. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Sia"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is

					<content>...Like Clockwork is the sixth studio album by American rock band Queens of the Stone Age,
                    released on June 3, 2013 on Matador Records in the UK and on June 4 in the United States.
                    Self-produced by the band, it is the first Queens of the
                    Stone Age album to feature full contributions from bassist Michael Shuman and keyboardist and
                    guitarist Dean Fertita, who both joined the band in 2007 to tour in support of their fifth studio
                    album, Era Vulgaris, and recorded its bonus
                    tracks.

The band began recording ...Like Clockwork in August 2012, initially hoping that
                    collaborator Trent Reznor would produce the album. Following a tumultuous recording period, which
                    included the departure of long-time drummer Joey
                    Castillo, founding member Josh Homme described the album as "documenting the journey of moving
                    forward, you know. It was a tough time and I thought, 'I can run away from this, or I can run
                    into it.'"
The album received
                    widespread critical acclaim upon its release, reaching number two on the UK Albums Chart and number
                    one on the Billboard 200, making it Queens of the Stone Age's highest U.S. chart position to
                    date and their first album to top the charts in the
                    United States. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/...Like+Clockwork"&gt;Read

The

                    songwriting style that Joshua Homme dubbed "robot rock", similar to the extended jam
                    sessions of his previous band Kyuss. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age"&gt;Read

                    Secret", "Better Living Through Chemistry" and "Quick and to the Pointless".

The
                    B-sides are "Ode To Clarissa", "You're So Vague", covers of Romeo Void's
                    "Never Say Never" and
                    the Kinks' "Who'll Be The Next in Line", a live version of the album's
                    "Monsters in the Parasol", a song originally from Josh Homme's side project, The
                    Desert Sessions, and a re-recording of "Born To
                    Hula", an early song from Kyuss/Queens of the Stone Age EP. The other Reading Festival tracks
                    are concert takes on "Ode To Clarissa", three songs from the band’s debut album ("Regular
                    John", "Avon" and "You
                    Can't Quit Me, Baby"), and "You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a
                    Millionaire", another track originally by The Desert Sessions, which was also present on their
                    third album, Songs for the Deaf.

                    success and its popularity peaked when the album reached gold status in 2003, with sales peaking at
                    over 900,000 copies. The singles "No One
                    Knows" and "Go with the Flow" became hits on radio and MTV, with the former peaking
                    just outside of the Billboard Top 40. Constant touring continued, culminating in a string of
                    headline dates in Australia in January of 2004, after
                    which Oliveri was fired from the band by Homme for what was said to be disrespect of the group's
                    fans and excessive partying. In July 2005 however, Homme claimed in a BBC Radio 1 interview that
                    Oliveri was fired when Homme had become convinced
                    that he had been physically abusive to his (Oliveri's) girlfriend. Homme said, "A couple
                    years ago, I spoke to Nick about a rumor I heard. I said, 'If I ever find out that this is
                    true, I can't know you, man.'" Oliveri
                    countered in the press that the band had been "poisoned by hunger for power" and that the
                    band without him was "Queens Lite;" later Oliveri softened his opinion and said, "My
                    relationship with Josh is good. The new Queens
                    record kicks ass." As of October 2006, Oliveri remains interested in rejoining the band

				<summary>Queens of the Stone Age is a rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band's
        founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as "robot rock", saying that he "wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head". Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of
        different styles and influences. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Queens+of+the+Stone+Age"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>
				<content>Queens of the Stone Age is a rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band's
        founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as "robot rock", saying that he "wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head". Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of
        different styles and influences.

While in high school, Homme got together with locals Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell (later replaced by Nick Oliveri) and John Garcia resulting in the formation of Kyuss (firstly known as "Sons of
        Kyuss"). Queens of the Stone Age formed in 1997, rising from the ashes of Kyuss and began playing together during the now legendary Desert Sessions. Homme has drawn all of the members from that diverse group of musicians for Queens of the Stone
        Age. The band originally formed under the name Gamma Ray, but almost faced a lawsuit from the European metal band of the same name.

Queens of the Stone Age have gone through many line-up changes since first breaking into the hard rock scene.
        Their most recent line-up includes: Josh Homme (guitar, vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Theodore (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing
        vocals).

Former core members include Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Mark Lanegan, and Nick Oliveri, among other members and contributors. In 2002, regarding the band line-up, Homme said: "It really is more of a musical
        experiment… It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner."

Dave Grohl recorded drums, percussion and backing vocals on Songs for the Deaf and toured in support of the album in 2002 before returning
        to the Foo Fighters. Grohl also made a live appearance in 2007, to play Make It wit Chu, and recorded tracks on …Like Clockwork, following Joey Castillo's departure.

Mark Lanegan has long been an on/off vocalist for the band, toured
        from 2001 to 2005 and made live appearances in 2007 and 2010. He has recorded with the band on all albums except for their self-titled debut album. Lanegan has also played keyboards in live performances during the tour preceding the release of
        Lullabies to Paralyze, before Natasha Shneider joined the band.

Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri were seen as the only two consistent Queens of the Stone Age members. Oliveri had previously played alongside Homme in the band Kyuss and joined
        Queens of the Stone Age as its permanent bass guitarist and co-lead vocalist, in 1998, upon the release of its debut album, Queens of the Stone Age. Being friends since childhood, the two meshed well together. Oliveri's punk background brought
        an element of danger and attitude to the Queens' live shows. As the band's two core members, the duo recorded the breakthrough albums, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf, together. Oliveri's unique "howling" singing style made
        him easily distinguishable on songs such as Six Shooter from the album Songs for the Deaf; he also displays a more melodic singing style in Rated R songs such as Auto Pilot.

However, Homme fired Oliveri in 2004 for excessive partying and an
        alleged incident of domestic abuse (an accusation which Oliveri strongly denies). The duo repaired their friendship shortly afterwards. Oliveri, however, did not return to the band. In 2013, upon hearing that former contributor Dave Grohl was
        recording drums for the band's sixth studio album, …Like Clockwork, Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Homme ultimately did not grant Oliveri's request. He does, however, appear on backing vocals on the album track,
        If I Had a Tail.

					<summary>Artpop (stylized as ARTPOP) is the third studio album recorded by American singer Lady Gaga,
                    released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and Interscope Records. Gaga began planning the project
                    in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second
                    effort, Born This Way. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her Born This

					<content>Artpop (stylized as ARTPOP) is the third studio album recorded by American singer Lady Gaga,
                    released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and Interscope Records. Gaga began planning the project
                    in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second
                    effort, Born This Way. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her Born This
                    Way Ball concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring.
                    Gaga described Artpop as "a celebration and a
                    poetic musical journey" and an exploration of the "reverse Warholian" phenomenon in
                    pop culture. It displays an intentional "lack of maturity and responsibility" by
                    comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This
                    Way. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including Paul "DJ White Shadow"
                    Blair, RedOne, Zedd and Madeon. Lyrically, Artpop revolves around Gaga's personal views of
                    fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include
                    Greek and Roman mythology. It also features guest vocals from T.I., Too Short, Twista, and R. Kelly.

The
                    release of Artpop was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed ArtRave. The album received
                    generally mixed reviews from music
                    critics, but was commercially successful, debuting at number one on United States' Billboard
                    200 with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one
                    record in the country and selling 757,000 copies. It
                    also topped national record charts in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in
                    over 20. Artpop was the ninth best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide, having
                    sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014. It was also
                    included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications.

					<summary>The Fame Monster is the third extended play (EP) by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was
                    released on November 18, 2009, by Interscope Records. Initially planned to be included on a

                    that the eight tracks would be included on a standalone release, saying that she thought the
                    re-release was too expensive and that the albums were each conceptually different, describing them
                    as yin and yang respectively. &lt;a

					<content>The Fame Monster is the third extended play (EP) by American recording artist Lady Gaga. It was
                    released on November 18, 2009, by Interscope Records. Initially planned to be included on a
                    re-release of her 2008 album The Fame, Gaga announced
                    that the eight tracks would be included on a standalone release, saying that she thought the
                    re-release was too expensive and that the albums were each conceptually different, describing them
                    as yin and yang respectively. A Super Deluxe edition of
                    The Fame Monster including The Fame and additional merchandise, including a lock of her wig, was
                    released on December 15, 2009.

Musically, The Fame Monster is a pop album influenced by a
                    number of genres, prominently the disco, glam rock,
                    and synthpop music of the 1970s and 1980s, as well as industrial and gothic music. The album was
                    also inspired by fashion shows and runways. According to Gaga, the album deals with the darker side
                    of fame, including love, sex, alcohol and more.
                    Lyrically, they are expressed through a monster metaphor. The cover artwork was done by Hedi Slimane
                    and has a theme, as described by Gaga herself. The artwork was originally declined by her record
                    company, however, Gaga convinced them to go through
                    with it. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame+Monster"&gt;Read more on

                    visualizes Gaga's love of fame in general
                    while also dealing with subjects such as love, sex, money, drugs and sexual identity. Promotion was
                    primarily through The Fame Ball Tour and multiple television appearances. The Fame was reissued as a
                    deluxe edition with The Fame Monster on November
                    18, 2009.

The album received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended
                    the album's lyrical content and Gaga's musicianship and vocal ability. The album was a
                    commercial success, topping the charts in different
                    countries worldwide, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Poland and Switzerland.
                    In the United States, it peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while topping the
                    Dance/Electronic Albums chart for 106 non-consecutive weeks.
                    The Fame became the fifth best-selling album of 2009. It has sold 4.7 million copies in the United
                    States as of April 2016 and is the seventh best-selling digital album in history. The album had sold
                    15 million copies worldwide as of November
                    2010.

The first two singles from The Fame—"Just Dance" and "Poker Face"—gained
                    international success, topping the charts in several countries worldwide, including the United
                    States, United Kingdom and Australia.
                    Subsequent singles "LoveGame" and "Paparazzi", were commercial successes as
                    well, charting within the top 10 of more than 10 countries worldwide. "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I
                    Can Say)" had a limited release, while
                    "Beautiful, Dirty, Rich" was a promotional single. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/The+Fame"&gt;Read

					<content>Alive 2007 is a live album by Daft Punk, first released on November 19, 2007. It is the second
                    album recorded live by the duo, following Alive 1997. Alive 2007 features their performance at Bercy
                    in Paris from June 14, 2007.
The physical
                    release in North America was delayed to December 4 due to production issues, but the album became
                    available as a digital download on November 20, 2007. A special edition of the album was released
                    that includes the encore from the Alive 2007 tour on a
                    second disc. It also includes a 50-page book containing photographs from the tour taken by DJ
                    Falcon. The first single from the album, "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger (Alive 2007)"
                    was released digitally on October 15, 2007.
The album
                    won the Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2008.

Structure

The Alive
                    2007 set used Ableton Live software on "custom made super-computers" for the show. Daft
                    Punk accessed the hardware remotely with Behringer
                    BCR2000 MIDI controllers and JazzMutant Lemur touchscreen pads within the central pyramid. Minimoog
                    Voyager RME units were also implemented for the live performances. The four Voyager units and two
                    Behringer mixers allowed Daft Punk to "mix,
                    shuffle, trigger loops, filter, distort samples, EQ in and out, transpose or destroy and deconstruct
                    synth lines." The majority of the equipment was stored away during the live sets within
                    offstage towers.
The recording of Alive 2007 was
                    derived from Daft Punk's live performance at their Bercy show on June 14, 2007. Reviews of the
                    set noted how Daft Punk manipulated and reworked their established material. One report spotted
                    vocal elements from the song "Too Long"
                    mixed with newly-generated accompaniment. The overlapped mixtures of "Television Rules the
                    Nation" with "Crescendolls", "Around the World" with "Harder, Better,
                    Faster, Stronger" and "Superheroes"
                    with "Human After All" were reported to be well received by the audience. The set itself
                    was considered a collection of Daft Punk's most popular recordings. The performances heavily
                    featured tracks from Daft Punk's album Human
                    After All, prompting critics to reconsider what they felt about the album.

The visuals of
                    the 2006 and Alive 2007 tour were set up by XL Video. The company provided eight-core Mac Pro units
                    running Catalyst v4 and Final Cut Pro. Daft Punk
                    approached the company with their visual concept for the shows. "They came to us with a pretty
                    fixed idea of what they wanted," said head of XL Video, Richard Burford. "They wanted to
                    mix live video with effects. Using the eight-core
                    Mac Pros, we were able to take in eight digital sources and treat them as video streams. Then they
                    could use Catalyst to coordinate the video with lighting effects and add their own effects in on the
                    fly. The final digital video streams ran to LED
                    screens."
The performances for the Alive 2007 tour were an expansion of Daft Punk's
                    2006 live sets. Noted additions include elements of the tracks "Burnin'" and "Phoenix"
                    as well as an encore. Bangalter
                    explained that the 2006 sets were initially designed for performances within larger festivals, but
                    later refined to accommodate Daft Punk-specific shows. "The goal was to try and bring a
                    complete global experience to the audience." The
                    introduction for the live show featured the five-note sequence used in Close Encounters of the Third
                    Kind.
The album includes elements of the Busta Rhymes song "Touch It", the original
                    version of which was produced by Swizz Beatz
                    featuring a sample of "Technologic". Also featured are elements of Gabrielle's "Forget
                    About the World", the original version of which was remixed by Daft Punk for her single. The
                    encore of the Alive 2007 set features
                    Bangalter's side projects: Stardust's "Music Sounds Better with You" and
                    Together's self-titled track "Together".

Reception

Alive 2007 was
                    met with positive reviews upon release. Pitchfork Media
                    regarded the recording as "the Ultimate Daft Punk Mixtape", specifically noting how songs
                    from the album Human After All had been "constantly improved and born anew" for the live
                    set. The sentiment was also shared by Allmusic,
                    stating that "It has the feel of a greatest-hits-live concert, but energized by Daft Punk's
                    talents at weaving songs in and out of each other." The publication ultimately considered Alive
                    1997 the stronger of their two live albums,
                    however. A review by The Star noted that the release and Daft Punk's concurrent tours
                    cumulatively restored the duo's reputation following the mixed reception of their two earlier
                    studio albums.
Sputnikmusic stated that the Alive 2007
                    performance was closer to a theatrical production than a traditional concert, and that the album
                    "could just as easily be a studio concoction". Entertainment Weekly however felt that the
                    live crowd enhanced the positive mood of the
                    performance. Rolling Stone stated that Alive 2007 "loses some of the essential experience"
                    of attending the live Daft Punk events. The Phoenix also felt that the album package would have
                    benefited from more video content, expressing that a
                    key factor of the live show was its implementation of visual elements. In his first positive review
                    for a Daft Punk album, Robert Christgau believed that a full video representation was avoided
                    because "too much scale, flesh and bodily effluvia
                    would be lost." Thomas Bangalter expressed his reasons of not releasing a DVD by stating "the
                    thousands of clips on the internet are better to us than any DVD that could have been released."
On
                    December 3, 2008, Alive 2007 and its
                    single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" received Grammy Award nominations for Best
                    Electronic/Dance Album and Best Dance Recording, respectively. Both the album and the single were
                    announced as winners during the 51st Grammy Awards
                    pre-telecast ceremony. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Alive+2007"&gt;Read

					<content>Discovery is the second studio album by the French house duo Daft Punk, released in March 2001.
                    It marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house, which they were previously known for, to disco,
                    post-disco and synthpop-inspired house. The
                    album provided itself as a soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret
                    5tar 5ystem, which was a collaboration between the creators of the album, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei
                    Animation.
All of the music videos for the
                    tracks on the album are segments of the film. Interstella 5555 follows a story of a kidnapped
                    extraterrestrial band. Discovery is recognized as a concept album in reviews by New Musical Express
                    and Spin magazines. Early versions of the album included
                    a "Daft Club" membership card. The card included a code which granted access to an online
                    music service, which featured tracks later released on the album of the same name and Alive 1997.

Theme

According
                    to an interview
                    with Remix Magazine Online, Thomas Bangalter stated:
This album has a lot to do with our
                    childhood and the memories of the state we were in at that stage of our lives. It's about our
                    personal relationship to that time. It's less of a
                    tribute to the music from 1975 to 1985 as an era, and more about focusing on the time when we were
                    zero to ten years old. When you're a child you don't judge or analyze music. You just like
                    it because you like it. You're not concerned
                    with whether it's cool or not. Sometimes you might relate to just one thing in a song, such as
                    the guitar sound. This album takes a playful, fun, and colorful look at music. It's about the
                    idea of looking at something with an open mind and
                    not asking too many questions. It's about the true, simple, and honest relationship you have
                    with music when you're open to your own feelings.
Leiji Matsumoto supervised the creation
                    of several music videos for Discovery. The videos
                    later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar
                    5ystem. It was created as a collaboration between Matsumoto, Daft Punk, Cédric Hervet and Toei
                    Animation. The film features the entire album as its
                    soundtrack. Regarding the album from the perspective of animation, Daft Punk stated that, "We
                    think the music we made on Discovery has been done in a cinematic way in our minds. We were visually
                    seeing the music and trying to find ideas that
                    were appealing to people's imagination. An animation fan would find this mixture of elements
                    and story in our music."

Production

A significant amount of sampling is
                    present on the album. Rather than simply creating new
                    music out of the samples, Daft Punk worked with them by writing and adding instrumental performance.
                    The Discovery liner notes specify permitted use of samples for four tracks on the album: Part of
                    George Duke's "I Love You More" is
                    featured in "Digital Love"; Edwin Birdsong's "Cola Bottle Baby" was sampled
                    for "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"; The Imperials song "Can You Imagine" is
                    used for "Crescendolls"; Barry
                    Manilow's "Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed" is credited for "Superheroes".
Several
                    websites list many other samples present on the album, but Bangalter has stated that half of the
                    samples listed are not true. He also
                    stated the sampling they do is legitimately done, not something they try to hide. Guy-Manuel de
                    Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on Discovery was played live by the duo:
“
                    I play more guitar usually, and Thomas plays more
                    keyboards and bass. There's no ego involved. We don't argue about who's playing what.
                    You can get the sound of a guitar with a keyboard, or the opposite. We don't really care about
                    who's doing what as long as it's
                    well-done. At the same time, when you use samples, you don't have this problem. When you use a
                    sampler, nobody plays on it, so the problem of the ego of the musician is not really there. For
                    everything that we do, no matter how you get to the
                    results, the important thing is the result. ”

Featured artists

The album features
                    guest appearances by Romanthony, Todd Edwards and DJ Sneak. In regard to working with guest artists,
                    de Homem-Christo stated:
“ We met Romanthony
                    at the 1996 Winter Music Conference and became friends. Before that, we mentioned his name on
                    “Teachers,” thanking him for his influences. We wanted to invite him to sing with us because he
                    makes emotional music. What's odd is that Romanthony
                    and Todd Edwards are not big in the United States at all. Their music had a big effect on us. The
                    sound of their productions, the compression, the sound of the kick drum, and Romanthony's
                    voice... The emotion and soul is part of how we sound
                    today. Because they mean something to us, it was much more important for us to work with them than
                    with other big stars. ”

Giving his take on working with Romanthony and Edwards, Bangalter
                    stated:
“ We wanted to work with Romanthony and
                    Todd Edwards on our first album. They didn't know who we were at the time, so it was very
                    difficult to convince them. When we met Romanthony in Miami, he told us he was very into what we
                    were doing, which made us very happy. They are the house
                    producers who were the biggest influence on us. Working with them was a way for us to close the
                    circle. It was very important for us to do that, because they are part of what we do. Now that we've
                    worked with them, we are free to explore other
                    areas. It will be interesting to see what we'll do next. Now we can work with other people. ”

DJ
                    Sneak also discussed working with Daft Punk on the album:
“ I went to Paris on one trip, got
                    together with the boys and had a private
                    party at the loft house where Thomas had just moved into in a rare form of musical display we
                    decided to make beats in front of a few guests. The next few days we continued to work on the music
                    and I sat back and wrote the lyrics to "Digital
                    Love". I had written other things but this song was very special from the get-go. I also
                    co-produced the music and they polished it and finished a masterpiece. ”

Reception

Upon
                    release, critics noted the immediate style
                    differences of Discovery from Homework. The change in aesthetic was a jarring move for fans of Daft
                    Punk's earlier work and initially caused some critics to pan the album. Discovery gained praise
                    in later years; the album ranked #12 in Pitchfork
                    Media's Top 100 Albums of 2000–04 and #3 in their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s despite receiving
                    an initial rating of 6.4. In 2009, Rhapsody ranked the album at #12 on its "100 Best Albums of
                    the Decade" list. It was also named the 4th
                    best album of the decade by Resident Advisor. Q rated the album five stars out of five, an unusual
                    occurrence for the magazine. Regarding the album's structure, the magazine Spin noted that,
                    "It feels like a concept album -- in this case,
                    the story of how wine-flow disco circumnavigated intellectual pretensions on all sides en route to a
                    temporary utopia that may finally believe in nothing but the boogie but still has the infinite on
                    its mind every minute." NME referred to
                    Discovery as "audaciously weird" and added: "With its famously camera-shy creators
                    now dressing as funkadelic Power Rangers, it is also something of a concept album."
The
                    album peaked at #2 in the United Kingdom and #44 in the
                    United States. Discovery has sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005. The album was certified
                    triple platinum in France (in 2007) for shipments denoting 600,000 copies. As a result of sales,
                    Discovery was certified Gold by the RIAA as of October
                    11, 2010. Two cult hits were spawned from this album: "One More Time" and "Harder,
                    Better, Faster, Stronger". The song "Face to Face" (featuring Todd Edwards) reached
                    #1 on the Billboard Club chart in 2004. The album was
                    included on BBC Radio 1's Masterpieces in December 2009 presented by Zane Lowe, further
                    highlighting the progression of the reception of the album and showing how highly regarded the album
                    is amongst fans and fellow dance artists.
Several
                    songs from the album would later be sampled by other artists. Kanye West's song "Stronger"
                    from the album Graduation features a vocal sample of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger".
                    "Stronger" was later performed live
                    at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while Kanye West was on stage
                    rapping. Wiley's song "Summertime" from the album See Clear Now features a sample of
                    "Aerodynamic". Jazmine Sullivan's
                    song "Dream Big" from the album Fearless features a sample of "Veridis Quo". On
                    February 18, 2011, Trinity Orchestra played the first ever live full orchestral performance of
                    Discovery at Trinity College. The filmed performance
                    became the most watched YouTube video in Ireland on the day of its release. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Discovery"&gt;Read

					<summary>"Human After All" is the third studio album by French duo Daft Punk, first released
                    on March 14, 2005 internationally and a day later in the United States. With it, Daft Punk apply
                    Minimalism and rock music to their French house
                    musicstyle. It received mixed reviews noting its reported six-week creation, which is particularly
                    short compared to previous albums Discovery and Homework.

					<content>"Human After All" is the third studio album by French duo Daft Punk, first released
                    on March 14, 2005 internationally and a day later in the United States. With it, Daft Punk apply
                    Minimalism and rock music to their French house
                    musicstyle. It received mixed reviews noting its reported six-week creation, which is particularly
                    short compared to previous albums Discovery and Homework.

Conception

The Japanese
                    edition of the album artwork features a quote from
                    Daft Punk stating: "We believe that Human After All speaks for itself." In a later
                    statement, Daft Punk considered Human After All to be the favorite of their three studio albums and
                    regard it as "pure improvisation." The
                    album's brief creation and minimal production had been decided upon beforehand as counterpoint
                    to their previous album.As Thomas Bangalter stated, "We were definitely seduced at the time by
                    the idea of doing the opposite of Discovery."
                    Human After All was created mainly with two guitars and without synthesizers.Furthermore it was
                    produced in two weeks and mixed in four, a session in sharp contrast to their older material.

Bangalter
                    has stated that the album is an attempt
                    to discover where human feelings reside in music. He later commented that "we felt like the
                    third album was about this feeling of either fear or paranoia... [The record is] not something
                    intended to make you feel good". When questioned on
                    the positive reaction to the use of the tracks in Daft Punk's recent live performances,
                    Bangalter expressed that, "Human After All was the music we wanted to make at the time we did
                    it. We have always strongly felt there was a logical
                    connection between our three albums, and it's great to see that people seem to realize that
                    when they listen now to the live show."

The cover image of Human After All features
                    the Daft Punk logo displayed on a television screen.
                    Each single from the album ("Robot Rock", "Technologic", "Human After All"
                    and "The Prime Time of Your Life") features a cover with a different image on a similar
                    screen. This television theme is also expressed
                    with tracks from the album, including "On/Off" and "Television Rules the Nation".

Reception

When
                    the album was leaked on the Internet several months before release, fans speculated that it was a
                    fake designed to
                    foil online filesharing. Reviews noted that the album's tracks were overly repetitive and of
                    primitive quality. Critics also felt that, despite the re-affirmation of humanity suggested in its
                    title, the album remained overtly
                    mechanical.

Nevertheless, Human After All is seen as a strange and gutsy musical statement.
                    One review in Stylus Magazine stated, "it's the same story, track after track, willfully
                    mistaking alternation for variation,
                    intensification for development and dynamics. In other words, a shining example of pop songcraft in
                    the 21st century."

The recent live tour featuring tracks from Human After All caused
                    people to reconsider what they felt about the
                    album. Pedro Winter, Daft Punk's manager at the time, stated, "When we put out Human After
                    All, I got a lot of bad feedback, like, 'It's so repetitive. There's nothing new.
                    Daft Punk used to be good.' Then they came back
                    with the light show, and everyone shut their mouths... People even apologized, like, 'How could
                    we have misjudged Daft Punk?' The live show changed everything. Even if I'm part of it, I
                    like to step back and admire it. Me, I
                    cried."

The first single "Robot Rock" received moderate attention, reaching
                    #32 in the UK and #15 on the U.S. dance charts, but was not a major hit. The second single "Technologic"
                    only hit #40 in the UK but did
                    considerably better in airplay. The track has also been featured on The O.C. and in an iPod
                    commercial. A sample of the track has also been used as the chorus for Busta Rhymes' single
                    "Touch It".

Human After All was nominated
                    for the 2006 Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album.

Remix Album

Human After
                    All: Remixes was released on March 29, 2006 exclusively for Japan. It features numerous remixes
                    previously unavailable on CD in a limited pressing of
                    3,000 copies. A limited edition of the album included a set of Daft Punk Kubricks. The album

                    Columbia, a gradual promotional rollout began for the
                    album including billboards, television advertising and a web series.

Random Access Memories
                    pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the
                    sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft
                    Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the
                    use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also
                    features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian
                    Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams
                    and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has generally been positive. &lt;a

				<content>Daft Punk is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is
        considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. 

Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France, along with other artists such
        as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records.

The
        group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the
        compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011).


Early years (1987–1993)

Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in
        1987 on the grounds of the Lycée Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin' with Laurent
        Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original
        composition. 

Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that "The rock n' roll thing we did was pretty average, I think.
        It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it." A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music "a bunch of daft punk." Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found
        it to be amusing. As the latter stated, "We struggled so long to find [the name] Darlin', and this happened so quickly." Darlin' soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de
        Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers.


Homework era (1993–1999)

In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label
        Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "The New Wave", a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called
        "Alive".

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "Da Funk". It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager.
        They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their
        tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax.

"Da Funk" and "Alive" were later included on Daft Punk's 1997 debut album Homework. The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno,
        house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. "Da Funk" was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music
        that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was "Around the World", which is known for the repeating chant
        of the song's title.

Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D.A.F.T. - A Story about
        Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes.


Discovery era (1999–2004)

By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001's Discovery took on a slicker and
        distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in Homework. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery
        phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album.

It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single "One More Time" was a major club hit,
        creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles "Digital Love" and "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and
        "Face to Face" hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997.

2003
        first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club
        was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.


Human After All era (2004–present)

Starting on September 13 and ending
        November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from
        this album were "Robot Rock", "Technologic", "Human After All" and "The Prime Time of Your Life". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was "we believe that Human After All
        speaks for itself."

A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for "The Prime Time of Your Life" and "Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)".
        Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes. A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk's
        Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director's Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D.A.F.T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for
        Discovery). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007.

Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo's performance in Paris
        from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed
        by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk's Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71.

Following the
        Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed
        Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles.


Influences

Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources
        that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the
        founding of their own independent project, Darlin'. Bangalter expressed that "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band."They drew inspiration from the rock and acid
        house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record "put everything together" in terms of genre.

The liner notes of Homework
        pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that "In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too." When questioned
        on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, "before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not
        known and who have influenced people." The Daft Punk track "Teachers" on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of
        their productions — the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul — is part of how we sound today."

Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery. For
        the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single "Windowlicker", which was "neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track" according to
        Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, "On 'Digital Love' you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge," which was generated through an in-studio
        Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that "we didn't make a list of artists we like and copy their songs."


Visual components

Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components
        associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to
        Interstella 5555.

Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation
        (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes.

In their more
        visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc., sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects
        and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U.S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network's Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, "We did
        not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a.m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become
        robots."

During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the
        result of shyness. "But then it became exciting from the audiences' point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower." When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the
        robotic suits, Bangalter stated "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." With the release of Human After All, the musical
        duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane.

During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk's
        Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads
        during a televised interview.

It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and
        the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, "The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it."


Live performances

In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without
        costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter's right
        and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album's liner note photo was taken during this event.

In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to
        promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, "Everything was synched up —
        the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to."
        25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997.

At the
        start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U.S. performance since 1997.
        Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling
        than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances
        in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then
        announced a world tour called Alive 2007.

Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed,
        but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless
        Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a "memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening" and ThisisLondon declared it "an almost faultless set of relentless electro
        euphoria".

Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk's Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk
        appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was "a robotic spectacular", while Shoutmouth described the set as "typically triumphant". Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free
        Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy.

Daft Punk headlined the AT&amp;T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago. Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the
        experience of watching the performance "was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop." On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn, New York.

Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis
        Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At
        the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico.

Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007
        called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft
        Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane
        at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk's Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the
        pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would
        instead focus on new projects.

Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of "Stronger" on stage at the Staples Center in Los
        Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter's wife, Élodie Bouchez, also attended the
        event.

Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to
        focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ
        Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger".


Daft Punk in DJ Hero
Daft Punk provided eleven
        new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk's
        playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song "Human After All".

At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron:
        Legacy. Daft Punk's score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst
        Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements.

Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks
        within the film's virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track "Derezzed" from Tron:
        Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online
        vendors. An official music video for "Derezzed", with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot
        footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn's Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron:
        Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011.

In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records
        released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called "Drive" that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording "Rollin' and Scratchin'" and "Da Funk". The track was
        included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No.
        2 on Mixmag's Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points.

In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane's Yves Saint
        Laurent fashion show.[40] The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine's annual Top 100 DJs list.

Daft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers.
        Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo's upcoming album. Rodgers
        later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk's new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed
        that this would not be the case.

In May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked,
        the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder's life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for
        the duo's project in a one-day session: "I played for hours and they’re gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever." He also said that the album would be released "next spring".

In an interview conducted on
        28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number
        of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated "The next time [he sets] foot in Japan, [his] collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people's
        eardrums".

					<content>Absolution is the third studio album by English alternative rock band Muse. It was released on
                    September 21, 2003 in the UK and on March 23, 2004 in the U.S. by Taste Music Limited. The album
                    yielded the band's first big American hits -
                    "Time Is Running Out" and "Hysteria", the former becoming their first UK Top 10
                    single. Recently it was voted the 21st best British album ever.

Writing and composition:

The
                    band spent much of 2002 recording
                    Absolution with producer Rich Costey. The album was recorded in studios in both Los Angeles and
                    London. Bellamy said that the band made a "conscious decision" to "get together in a
                    room and make music", setting aside time to
                    record the album, as with previous albums recording sessions were 'hastily arranged' and
                    rushed.

The album incorporates themes of fear, mistrust, personal achievement and joy.
                    Bellamy said that the beginning of the Iraq War had an
                    effect on their songwriting.

Stockholm Syndrome, The Small Print, Time is Running Out and
                    Ruled by Secrecy can all be perceived as having political undertones. The former contains lyrics
                    such as "This is the last time I'll/ Forget
                    you/ I wish I could" that alludes to methods of control used by totalitarian states such as
                    Hitler's / Stalin's Cult of the Personality, which force people to form a "bond"
                    with their dictator. However it could also be
                    interpreted as a critical view of the way the West democracies (US and UK) after 9/11 sacrificed
                    civil rights in the name of "the war on terror". The title "Stockholm Syndrome"
                    (a psychological phenomenon where victims become
                    strangely infatuated with their kidnappers) suggests that citizens of the West have become hijacked
                    and victims of war mongering politicians by lies (the case for Iraq War). Ruled by Secrecy may also
                    refer to Judgement Day. The Small Print was
                    initially titled "Action Faust", Faust being a character in a play who sold his soul to
                    the Devil in return for the Devil's service in life. This may refer to the Biblical figure of
                    the Antichrist or simply be a metaphor- in an effort
                    to survive, people might resort to terrible actions. However "Small Print" can be also
                    viewed as a scream against the policies of record labels and the position of the artist. As lyrics
                    go: "For 15 pound per year / but just the good
                    days" can be interpreted as an exploitation of the artist, because the record label buys only
                    what they think is good (the good days), ignoring the artists troubles (the bad days). In fact as if
                    the artist was a machine, and when the machine
                    doesn't have good days anymore - it gets axed (perhaps a reflection of the dispute about the
                    "Origin of Symmetry" album and its release in the US with the record label).

The
                    album also considers how people may react to the end
                    of the world depending on their religion or lack of it. Sing for Absolution appears to show the
                    viewpoint of a person comforted by their love for another and perhaps their religion. Thoughts of a
                    Dying Atheist, meanwhile offer a parallel- a person
                    "Trapped beneath my pillow" unable to comprehend what is happening or find even a futile
                    hope - "It scares the hell out of me/ And the end is all I can see."

The track
                    "Blackout" featured an 18 - piece
                    orchestra.

Personnel:

 * Matthew Bellamy – lead vocals, guitars, piano,
                    synthesizers, mandolin on "Blackout"
 * Chris Wolstenholme – backing vocals, bass
                    guitar, synthesizers on "Hysteria" and "Time Is
                    Running Out"
 * Dominic Howard – drums, percussion
 * Paul Reeve – backing vocals,
                    vocal samples &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/Absolution"&gt;Read more on

                    relationship ending and a person becoming
                    dead inside themselves”.

					<content>Origin of Symmetry is the second studio album by English alternative rock band Muse, released
                    on 17 June 2001 by Mushroom Records. Recording took place at Ridge Farm Studios in Surrey and Real
                    World Studio in Wiltshire, and additional
                    recordings were made at Astoria Studios, Richmond Studios and Abbey Road Studios in London and
                    Sawmills Studio in Fowey, Cornwall. The album was mixed at Sawmills and mastered at Sony Music
                    Studios in London. Origin of Symmetry was produced by David
                    Bottrill, John Leckie (who previously worked on the band's first album, Showbiz) and the band
                    themselves. In the UK it reached #3 and was certified platinum. The title for the album comes from a
                    concept put forward by Michio Kaku in his book
                    Hyperspace.

The album was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews and in 2006 earned the
                    spot of 74 on Q Magazine's 100 Greatest Albums of all Time.

Origin of Symmetry is seen
                    as a departure from the alternative rock sound of
                    Showbiz, as the band experimented instrumentally throughout the album. Dominic Howard (drums)
                    augmented the standard rock drum kit with various other items of his own, and Matthew Bellamy uses a
                    pipe organ at St Mary the Virgin's Church,
                    Bathwick on "Megalomania". Due to the requirement of a pipe organ, this song is rarely
                    played live by Muse, perhaps the most notable occasions being at Muse's charity gig at the
                    Royal Albert Hall and during the Hullabaloo concert in
                    Paris.

Throughout the album, the bass line is used as the driving force, often with the
                    guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody. The bass has
                    distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a
                    greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main chord progression and play higher
                    notes.

Controversy:

Maverick Records, who previously released Showbiz in the
                    United States, asked the band to remove the falsetto vocals
                    for the album's release, claiming that their presence would discourage radio play. Muse's
                    refusal saw them part ways with the label, meaning that the album was not released in the US until
                    2005.

Nestlé tried to use the song
                    "Feeling Good" in a coffee commercial, though the band refused to give the company
                    permission to do so. After using the song anyway, the band successfully sued Nestlé for £500,000,
                    which the band donated to the charity
                    Oxfam.

"Survival"
                    was released as the album's first
                    single on 27 June 2012. Premiering on BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe show, along with the song's

                    Olympics Games.

"Madness" was
                    revealed as the second single by Muse in an interview with NME magazine. Released on August 20,
                    2012, it was announced that the song "Madness" would make its world premiere on BBC Radio
                    1 at 19:30 BST, but the track was leaked online
                    beforehand, due to an unintentional early release in South Korea.

"Panic Station"
                    was released as a promotional single from The 2nd Law in the days leading up to its release on 24
                    September 2012. Its first airplay occurred on
                    British alternative music station XFM. The band performed this track, as well as "Madness"
                    on the 6 October 2012 episode of Saturday Night Live.

"Follow Me" was revealed as
                    the third single when several promo CD's
                    allegedly sent to radio stations appeared on eBay.The official lyric video was released on Muse's
                    YouTube channel on 1 November 2012.

"Supremacy" was announced as the fourth
                    single by Muse on 16 January 2013 along with the
                    release of a lyric video.

The title as well as the artwork are science-related: The law in
                    the title is a nod to the Second Law of Thermodynamcis whereas the artwork features a rendering of
                    the connections in a healthy brain by the Human
                    Connectome Project. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Muse/The+2nd+Law"&gt;Read more on

					<summary>The Resistance is the fifth studio album by English alternative rock band Muse, released in
                    Europe on 14 September 2009, and in North America on 15 September 2009. Many consider this album to
                    be the final installment in a 'trilogy'
                    of apocalypse themed albums by Muse (Absolution, Black Holes and Revelations and now The
                    Resistance). The main themes of the album are political corruption, alien invasion, New World Order
                    conspiracies and more conventional love songs. &lt;a

					<content>The Resistance is the fifth studio album by English alternative rock band Muse, released in
                    Europe on 14 September 2009, and in North America on 15 September 2009. Many consider this album to
                    be the final installment in a 'trilogy'
                    of apocalypse themed albums by Muse (Absolution, Black Holes and Revelations and now The
                    Resistance). The main themes of the album are political corruption, alien invasion, New World Order
                    conspiracies and more conventional love songs. The album is
                    heavily influenced by George Orwell's '1984', as is made clear by the title of the
                    song 'United States Of Eurasia' and the love story theme and the mention of 'Thought
                    Police' in the lyrics of the track
                    'Resistance' . On 13 February 2011 the album was awarded a Grammy for 'Best Rock
                    Album'.

The album covers a large range of genres, as with most Muse albums, including
                    electro-pop, pop-rock, prog-rock and operatic-rock.
                    The main genre of the album is rock, however there are some electronic influences and strong
                    classical influences. The song 'I Belong To You' also contains an adapted excerpt of a
                    french opera.

On its release, it topped the album
                    charts in 19 countries. It also debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 128,000
                    copies.[13] It also beat its predecessor, Black Holes and Revelations, in relative album sales in
                    its debut week in the UK selling approximately 148,000
                    copies and Worldwide with 479,000 copies sold. Critics were mostly positive about the album, with
                    much of the praise directed towards its ambition and classical music influences, with most critics
                    directing high praise to 'Exogenesis:
                    Symphony'. The album was produced by the band and mixed by Mark Stent.[14][15] The album's
                    first single, "Uprising", was released on 7 September 2009, with the album's second
                    single, "Undisclosed Desires" released
                    on 16 November 2009. "Resistance" was released as the third single from the album on 22
                    February 2010, and although it failed to match the success of its predecessors, the single reached
                    number one in the UK Rock Chart and became the second
                    Top 40 hit from the album in the UK Singles Chart. Exogenesis: Symphony was released as a limited
                    edition EP in the United States on 19 April 2010. Muse promoted the album by performing the songs in
                    a number of live appearances, including their
                    promotional tour The Resistance Tour. Worldwide, the album has sold over 2.8 million copies. &lt;a

				<content>Muse are an alternative rock band from Teignmouth, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Matthew Bellamy on lead vocals, piano, keyboard and guitar, Chris Wolstenholme on backing vocals and bass guitar, and Dominic Howard on drums
        and percussion. 

They have been friends since their formation in early 1994 and changed band names a number of times (such as Gothic Plague, Fixed Penalty, and Rocket Baby Dolls) before adopting the name Muse. Since the release of their
        fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals.

Their sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and
        progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater
        weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse´s piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff,
        Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock.

The band are known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy's eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy,
        extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and
        other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their fourth album 'Black Holes And
        Revelations' has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). 

In October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; 'Showbiz'. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans,
        labeling the band as 'Radiohead copycats'. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum. The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT
        Awards, for Best New Act.

2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born. The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their
        record label at the time, Madonna's Maverick, allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals. The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick.

Muse
        followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack, showcasing the band's concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving
        Muse could also write "radio-friendly" rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards.

In 2003, Muse asked Rich
        Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution. The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song
        Stockholm Syndrome. Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria, which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival.

Glastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table
        of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock. Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described
        as "the best gig of our lives." It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they'd 'made it'. However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard's
        father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site.

Later that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London's Earls Court at the end of the
        year.

In 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations.Interview with Dominic 2006

With the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst
        reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse's highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in
        other countries. The album's second single, Starlight, reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia, released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th
        single from Black Holes &amp; Revelations was Invincible, and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an
        award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named 'Best Live Act' at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007.

Two of the album's singles reached the highest US Modern
        Rock chart positions in the band's career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October. 2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in
        Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza.

Even when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out
        in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs. The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007. Already the gigs have been compared
        by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the "Hallowed Ground." The band's next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley, is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show.

In July 2007, Bellamy
        confirmed that he had begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or "dance" music and others more with classical or symphonic music. 

In January 2008 the song "Knights of Cydonia"
        was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia's biggest annual alternative music countdown.

In 2009, the band released The Resistance, which contained the successful single "Uprising", the band's first Top 40
        pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles "Resistance" and "Undisclosed Desires" also proved successful. 

The
        band's sixth album, The 2nd Law, was released on 1 October 2012. The album's first single, "Survival", is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The second single, "Madness" was released on 20 August
        2012. The third single, "Follow Me" was released on 7 December 2012, with an accompanying lyrics video released on the band's YouTube channel on 1 November 2012. The album has recieved generally positive reviews, with Allmusic noting
        "their excursions into dubstep and dance music on tracks like "Madness" and "Follow Me" feel more like remixes than original songs."

Their latest album Drones was released on June 5 2015, and the band is set to
        release a new single on May 18 2017. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Muse"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.</content>

                    Billboard Hot 100, and has thus far peaked at

                    April 2012 &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/Demi"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.</summary>
					<content>Demi is the fourth studio album by American recording artist Demi Lovato, released on May 14,
                    2013 by Hollywood Records. Its lead single "Heart Attack" debuted at number 12 on the U.S.
                    Billboard Hot 100, and has thus far peaked at
                    number 10, becoming her second highest-charting single in the country to date. Lovato posted all of
                    the songs on her website a week early, but they will be available on iTunes on May 14, as originally
                    planned.

Writing for the album began in
                    April 2012, while recording began later in the year in between Lovato's appearances as a mentor
                    on the second season of the American version of The X Factor. According to Lovato, the album will
                    "provide inspiration for girls everywhere who
                    are going through the same issues I've faced". Lovato also said a sequel to the song
                    "Skyscraper" is also included. "I'm incredibly proud of this album," she
                    said in a statement. "It's better than anything
                    I have ever done! I experimented with a variety of different sounds and poured my heart into writing
                    these songs. I'm so excited for everyone to finally get the chance to hear them!"

On
                    May 6, 2013, Lovato asked her Twitter
                    followers to "unlock" the entire album by putting song titles in hashtags. A special
                    website lovaticsspeeduptime.com was launched, displaying all the songs next to a clock that would
                    turn as tweets would be sent. Once a song became a
                    trending topic, its YouTube video was made available on VEVO. All the songs were unlocked within a
                    day.

"Heart Attack" was released as the lead single for the album on February 24,
                    2013. The song was written by Mitch Allan, Jason
                    Evigan, Sean Douglas and Nikki Williams, and produced by The Suspex. The song peaked at number 10 on
                    the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Lovato's third song to do so. The music video for "Heart
                    Attack was shot on March 13, 2013, and
                    released on April 9, 2013. Demi has performed the song live on several shows, including Good Morning
                    America and Jimmy Kimmel Live.

On May 1, Lovato tweeted "Doing something very exciting
                    today. Can you guess what it is? Something
                    I've never done before" A fan guessed and it is confirmed that she is directing her music
                    video for "Made in the USA" along with Ryan Palotta.

					<content>Don't Forget is the debut studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on
                    September 23, 2008 by Hollywood Records. Lovato started working on the album in September 2007,
                    during the filming of the Disney Channel
                    television film Camp Rock. Lovato co-wrote most of the songs with the American boy band the Jonas
                    Brothers, who produced the album alongside record producer John Fields. The album also includes Kara
                    DioGuardi, Jason Reeves and Rooney frontman Robert
                    Schwartzman, who collabrated from the album. Don't Forget features a glam rock sound and the
                    lyrics deal with various teen topics.

The album was met with generally positive reviews
                    from critics. Due to most of the album being produced
                    by the Jonas Brothers, critics noted distinctive similarities between the artists. Don't Forget
                    debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and was eventually certified Gold by the Recording
                    Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has sold
                    over 530,000 copies in the United States. Elsewhere, Don't Forget reached the top ten on the
                    Canadian Albums Chart and reached the top forty in Spain and New Zealand, as well as being certified
                    Gold in Brazil.

"Get Back" was
                    released as the lead single from the album and reached number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100. "La
                    La Land" was the second single from the album. The song peaked at number 52 in the United
                    States and inside the top 40 in Ireland and United
                    Kingdom. "Don't Forget" was the third single from the album. The song peaked at
                    number 41 in the United States. In 2009, Lovato embarked on her first headlining tour, the Demi
                    Lovato: Live in Concert tour, to promote the album along
                    with her sophomore effort, Here We Go Again (2009). &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/Don%27t+Forget"&gt;Read

					<summary>Here We Go Again is the second studio album by American singer Demi Lovato. It was released on

                    Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers,
                    as she wanted to work with different people and give the album a personal approach. Lovato
                    collaborated for the album with established songwriters and producers, such as E. Kidd Bogart, Gary
                    Clark, Toby Gad, John Mayer, Jon McLaughlin, Lindy Robbins

                    Lovato did not collaborate with the Jonas Brothers,
                    as she wanted to work with different people and give the album a personal approach. Lovato
                    collaborated for the album with established songwriters and producers, such as E. Kidd Bogart, Gary
                    Clark, Toby Gad, John Mayer, Jon McLaughlin, Lindy Robbins
                    and John Fields, who produced her previous album Don't Forget. Lovato also collaborated with
                    The Academy Is... lead singer William Beckett to write a song about a strained relationship with her
                    father, which was originally set to appear on the
                    album, but was later dropped. The song later appeared on her third album Unbroken (2011).

Here
                    We Go Again derives mainly from the pop rock genre, mixed with influences of power pop, jazz-pop,
                    soul and pop. Lovato wanted the album's
                    music to be less rock and more mellow than her previous album, while exploring more mature sounds
                    and lyrics.[citation needed] Critical reception of the album was positive; critics praised Lovato
                    for not relying on vocal manipulations and instead
                    showing off her natural ability. Although some critics called the album catchy, others felt that it
                    was predictable and at times too much alike Kelly Clarkson. Here We Go Again sold 108,000 copies
                    during its first week of release in the United States
                    and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Since its release, the album has sold over 500,000
                    copies in the US, and was certified Gold. Internationally, the album peaked inside the top 40 on
                    charts in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico,
                    New Zealand and Spain. It was certified Platinum in Brazil. As of 2014, the album has sold 496,000
                    copies in the United States.

"Here We Go Again" was released as the lead single
                    from the album in June 2009 and was Lovato's
                    first solo single to reach the top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 15. "Remember
                    December" was the second and final single from the album in January 2010. To promote the album,
                    Lovato embarked on her first headlining tour,
                    Demi Lovato: Live in Concert. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato/Here+We+Go+Again"&gt;Read

					<summary>Unbroken is the third studio album by American singer–songwriter Demi Lovato. The album was

                    The Final Jam and their soundtracks. &lt;a

					<content>Unbroken is the third studio album by American singer–songwriter Demi Lovato. The album was
                    released on September 20, 2011 by Hollywood Records. The lead single, "Skyscraper" was
                    released on July 12, 2011.
After the release and
                    disclosure of her second album, Here We Go Again, in the second half of 2009, Lovato was dedicated
                    to her acting career, with recordings for the series and movies Sonny with a Chance and Camp Rock 2:
                    The Final Jam and their soundtracks. Therefore,
                    recording the first track on this album was made only in July 2010 with producer Dapo Torimiro.
That
                    same month, the singer gave an interview to MTV, in which she said she was "creating a new
                    sound," it would be "fun. A little more
                    R&amp;B/pop." Later, in conversation with AHN, quoted Rihanna and Keri Hilson as influences. At
                    the time, she revealed she planned to work in no hurry on this album, stating that "Every other
                    album I haven’t had time to really take my time
                    and craft it like I really wanted to do because I was finding spare time between a television show,
                    and movies, and touring, and then all over again. I’ve worked on (the album) for the past year and
                    really gone hard over the past few months, but you
                    can definitely tell that I took my time with this record."
In August 2010, Demi entered in
                    the Camp Rock World Tour 2010 to release the movie Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam. In November, she left
                    the tour due to personal problems and was
                    admitted to a clinic for three months. During this time, the recordings were interrupted. Some time
                    after leaving the clinic, the singer returned to work on the album, in April 2011, it was reported
                    that she was also working with
                    producers/songwriters Sandy Vee and August Rigo. Later that month, was announced that she would
                    leave Sonny with a Chance, in which she portrayed Sonny Munroe, the main character. She left the
                    show because she wanted to focus on her music career more
                    than acting.

Lovato said in her column in Seventeen Magazine, in early June 2011:
I
                    love being back in the studio! It's been very therapeutic to be able to express my feelings and
                    talk about who I really am, through my music. It
                    also helps that I've been lucky enough to work with such talented people on the record so far!
                    With my new album, I'm hoping to provide inspiration for girls everywhere who are going through
                    the same issues I've faced. I think this
                    will come through in a lot of the material. My first single is really special to me— to me it
                    symbolizes my journey from the person I was to the happy healthy person I am today, and the fact
                    that people are able to rise above anything, despite the
                    odds. I'm so excited to share all of this with you guys! The experience has been amazing so far
                    and I'm really enjoying the whole process. There are definitely a lot of emotions that go into
                    making an album. I feel blessed, inspired, and
                    nervous with anticipation, but mostly, I feel excited about the future, and about sharing this new
                    record with my fans!
In July 2011, Demi described the album as "more mature" than
                    their previous sound and more fun and light than her
                    first single, "Skyscraper", while other tracks are more intense. On August 11th, 2011,
                    Demi used her Twitter account and Facebook page to announce the title of her album (Unbroken). &lt;a

				<content>Demi Lovato (born Demetria Devonne Lovato; August 20, 1992 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States) is an American singer, songwriter, philanthropist, and actress. In 2002, she made her debut as child actress in Barney &amp; Friends. In
        2008, she came to prominence as a starring cast member in the television film Camp Rock. She signed to Hollywood Records the same year, and released her debut studio album, Don't Forget, in September 2008. The album sold 89,000 copies within its
        first week, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 It has since been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 530,000. In 2009, Lovato was commissioned her own television series, Sonny with a Chance.
        That July, her second album, Here We Go Again, became her first to debut atop the U.S. Billboard 200, selling 108,000 copies in its first week and spawning the single of the same name which became her first to break the top 20 of the Billboard Hot
        100, peaking at number 15.
After the release of additional television films and their accompanying soundtracks in 2010, Lovato's personal struggles sent her acting career into hiatus, and saw the closure of her television show Sonny with a
        Chance after its second season. She released her third album, Unbroken, in September 2011. The album addresses several of her difficulties, notably her lead single "Skyscraper" which became her first single to be certified platinum by the
        RIAA. The second single, "Give Your Heart a Break", was later certified double-platinum in the United States. The album had been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Since 2012, Lovato has served as a judge and
        mentor on the American version of The X Factor. She released fourth album, Demi, in May 2013 to critical success, selling 110,000 copies within its first week, becoming her highest opening week to date. The album was preceded by its lead single,
        "Heart Attack", that February and was certified double-platinum by the RIAA. In September 2013, Lovato announced plans to go on a North American leg of her third headlining concert tour, The Neon Lights Tour in promotion of her fourth
        studio album Demi.
Throughout her music career, Lovato has embarked on several concert tours. In 2008, she served as the opening act for the Jonas Brothers' Burnin' Up Tour and Avril Lavigne's Best Damn Tour. Later that year, she
        embarked on her first promotional tour, the Demi Live! Warm Up Tour. Since then she has held two headlining concert tours, Demi Lovato: Live in Concert and A Special Night with Demi Lovato. Her work has additionally earned several accolades,
        including one MTV Video Music Award, twenty five Teen Choice Awards nominations, eleven of which she has won, four People's Choice Awards, one ALMA award, a Billboard Touring Award and several others. In 2013, Maxim ranked her 26th on their Hot
        100 while Billboard ranked her second on their Social 50 Artists of the Year. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Lovato is involved in philanthropic activities through charity work and various social and environmental causes. In May
        2013, she was awarded for her dedication as a mentor to teens and young adults with mental health challenges at a National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day hosted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in
        Washington. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Demi+Lovato"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;. User-contributed text is available under the Creative Commons By-SA License; additional terms may apply.</content>

					<summary>Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released 22

					<content>Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released 22
                    October 1969 on Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations

                    it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer
                    Eddie Kramer. The album furthered the lyrical themes
                    established on their debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969). This progress helped create a work that
                    became more widely acclaimed and influential than its predecessor. With elements of blues and folk
                    music, it also exhibits the band's evolving musical
                    style of blues-derived material and their guitar and riff-based sound.
Upon release, Led
                    Zeppelin II earned a considerable amount of sales and was Led Zeppelin's first album to reach
                    number one in the United Kingdom and United States. In
                    1970, art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Led
                    Zeppelin II. On 15 November 1999, it was certified 12x platinum by the Recording Industry
                    Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 12
                    million copies. Following its initial reception, it has been recognized by writers and music critics
                    as one of the greatest and most influential rock albums recorded. Led Zeppelin II has also been
                    cited by critics as a blueprint for heavy metal bands
                    that followed it. In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of
                    the 500 greatest albums of all time. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Led+Zeppelin+II"&gt;Read

                    III marked a change in focus for the band from
                    late 1960s hard rock to a more folk rock and acoustic inspired sound. These styles had been present
                    to a lesser degree in the band's first two releases, but here it was the main style - and one
                    that would remain prominent in the group's
                    later albums. This change in direction endeared the band to many progressive rock fans who would
                    never have listened to Led Zeppelin's established blues and rock repertoire. With Led Zeppelin
                    III the group's songwriting dynamic also
                    changed, from Page's domination of the first two albums towards a more democratic affair in
                    which all four group members offered up their own compositions and ideas - patterns that would
                    continue in future sessions.

The album contains
                    two songs which became key components of the band's live concert performances for many years:
                    "Immigrant Song" and "Since I've Been Loving You". The first of these,
                    written by Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, is about the
                    Norse invasions of England and was inspired by the band's recent live performance in Iceland.
                    "Since I've Been Loving You" is a classic, original blues in the key C minor
                    featuring heartfelt interplay by all four group members. It
                    would become a performance staple, especially from 1971 through 1973, replacing Willie Dixon's
                    "I Can't Quit You Baby" from the first album as the band's slow blues showcase.

The
                    album also featured the rock songs
                    "Celebration Day" and "Out on the Tiles", and the acoustic tracks "Bron-Yr-Aur
                    (Stomp)" and "That's the Way", the latter considered by Page to be a
                    breakthrough for still-developing lyric writer Plant. The
                    song "Gallows Pole" is actually an arrangement of a traditional folk song by that name,
                    also recorded by Lead Belly some thirty years earlier.

The album finishes with "Hats
                    Off To (Roy) Harper", a track dedicated to their
                    influential contemporary, Roy Harper, that both honours Harper’s work and acknowledges the band’s
                    roots in acoustic music. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Led+Zeppelin+III"&gt;Read

                    guitarist Jimmy Page frequently refers to the album in interviews as "the fourth album"
                    and Led Zeppelin IV, while singer Robert Plant thinks of it as "the fourth album, that's
                    it". After the band's reunion at the Ahmet

                    radio stations, including "Black Dog", "Rock and Roll", "When the Levee

					<content>Led Zeppelin is the debut album of English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was recorded in October
                    1968 at Olympic Studios in London and released on Atlantic Records on 12 January 1969. The album
                    featured integral contributions from each of the
                    group's four musicians and established Led Zeppelin's fusion of blues and rock. Led
                    Zeppelin also created a large and devoted following for the band, with their unique heavy metal
                    sound endearing them to a section of the counterculture on
                    both sides of the Atlantic.

Although the album initially received negative reviews, it was
                    commercially very successful and has now come to be regarded in a much more positive light by
                    critics. In 2003, the album was ranked number 29 on
                    Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

In August 1968,
                    the English rock band The Yardbirds had completely disbanded. Guitarist Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds'
                    sole remaining member, was left with rights to
                    the group’s name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in Scandinavia. For his new
                    band, Page recruited bassist John Paul Jones, vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham. During
                    September 1968, the group toured Scandinavia as The
                    New Yardbirds, performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as "Communication
                    Breakdown", "I Can't Quit You Baby", "You Shook Me", "Babe I'm
                    Gonna Leave You" and "How Many
                    More Times". The month after they returned to England, October 1968, Page changed the band's
                    name to Led Zeppelin, and the group entered Olympic Studios in London to record their debut album.

In
                    a 1990 interview, Page said that the
                    album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including
                    mixing), adding that he knows this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the
                    primary reasons for the short recording time was that the
                    material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin's
                    tour of Scandinavia in September 1968. As Page explained, "the band had begun developing the
                    arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I
                    knew what sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly."

In
                    addition, since the band had not yet signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Led Zeppelin's
                    manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions
                    entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In
                    another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom, "I
                    wanted artistic control in a vice grip, because I knew
                    exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the
                    first album before going to Atlantic. ... It wasn't your typical story where you get an advance
                    to make an album—we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in
                    hand ... Atlantic's reaction was very positive—I mean they signed us, didn't they?"

The
                    group recorded their songs reportedly for £1,782. Led Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis noted that "with
                    the possible exception of the 12
                    hours that the Beatles took to record their first album at Abbey Road, rarely has studio time been
                    used so economically. Led Zeppelin's debut album went on to gross more than £3.5 million, just
                    short of 2,000 times more than they
                    invested!"

For the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted Fender
                    Telecaster, a gift from Jeff Beck after Page recommended his boyhood friend to the Yardbirds in 1965
                    as potential replacement for Eric Clapton on lead guitar.
                    This was a different guitar from those he favoured for later albums (most notably a Gibson Les
                    Paul). Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier. He also used a Gibson J-200, borrowed
                    from Big Jim Sullivan, for the album's acoustic
                    tracks.

Led Zeppelin was produced by Jimmy Page and engineered by Glyn Johns, who had
                    previously worked with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who. According to Page, "The
                    first album is a live album, it really is, and it's
                    done intentionally in that way. It's got overdubs on it, but the original tracks are live."

Page
                    reportedly used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record,
                    demonstrating the innovations in
                    sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music
                    producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin Page
                    developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some
                    distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two.
                    By adopting this "distance equals depth" technique, Page became one of the first producers
                    to record a band's "ambient
                    sound"—the distance of a note's time-lag from one end of the room to the other.

Another
                    notable feature of the album was the "leakage" on the recordings of Robert Plant's
                    vocals. In a 1998 Guitar World interview,
                    Page stated that "Robert's voice was extremely powerful and, as a result, would get on
                    some of the other tracks. But oddly, the leakage sounds intentional."On the track "You
                    Shook Me", Page used the "backward echo"
                    technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved
                    by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over
                    again to get the echo preceding the
                    signal.

The album was one of the first albums to be released in stereo-only form; at the
                    time the practice of releasing both mono and stereo versions was the norm.

Led Zeppelin's
                    front cover, which was chosen by Page, features
                    a black-and-white image of the burning Hindenburg airship. The image refers to the origin of the
                    band's name itself: when Page, Jeff Beck and The Who's Keith Moon and John Entwistle were
                    discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked,
                    "It would probably go over like a lead balloon", and Entwistle allegedly replied, "...a
                    Lead Zeppelin!"

The album's back cover features a photograph of the band taken by
                    former-Yardbird Chris Dreja. The entire design
                    of the album's sleeve was coordinated by George Hardie, with whom the band would continue to
                    collaborate for future sleeves.

Hardie recalled that he originally offered the band a
                    design based on an old club sign in San Francisco—a
                    multi-sequential image of a phallic zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was
                    retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin's first two albums and a number of
                    early press advertisements. During the first few weeks of
                    release in the UK, the sleeve featured the band's name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When
                    this was switched to the now-common orange print later in the year, the turquoise-printed sleeve
                    became a collector's item.

The album
                    cover received widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed
                    as "The Nobs" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative
                    of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). von
                    Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the Hindenburg crashing in flames, threatened to have the show
                    pulled off the air. In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone that "The cover of Led Zeppelin. .
                    . shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic
                    glory, going down in flames. The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex,
                    catastrophe and things blowing up."

The conceptual originality of the album was
                    displayed on tracks such as "Good Times Bad
                    Times", "Dazed and Confused" and "Communication Breakdown", which had a
                    distinctively heavy sound to the ears of young rock fans in the late-1960s. Led Zeppelin also
                    featured delicate steel-string acoustic guitar by Page on
                    "Black Mountain Side", and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on their
                    adaptation of "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You".

"Dazed and Confused" is
                    arguably the album's centerpiece: a foreboding
                    arrangement featuring a descending bass line from Jones, heavy drumming from Bonham and some
                    powerful guitar riffs and soloing from Page. It also showcased Page playing guitar with a violin bow
                    (an idea suggested by David McCallum Sr., whom Page had
                    met while doing studio session work). The bowed guitar in the middle section of the song brought
                    psychedelic rock to experimental new heights, especially in extended stage versions, building on
                    Page's earlier renderings of the song during the
                    latter days of The Yardbirds. "Dazed and Confused" would become Led Zeppelin's
                    signature performance piece for years to come. The bowed guitar technique is also used on "How
                    Many More Times", a song which features a
                    "Bolero" riff and an improvised shift in cadence.

Many of Led Zeppelin's
                    earliest songs were based on blues standards, and the album also included three songs composed by
                    others: "You Shook Me" and "I Can't
                    Quit You Baby", both by blues artist Willie Dixon; and "Babe I'm Gonna Leave You".
                    Regarding the last of these, at the time guitarist Jimmy Page mistakenly believed he was adapting a
                    traditional folk song he had heard on a Joan
                    Baez record, but this was corrected on subsequent rereleases after it was revealed that the song was
                    composed by Anne Bredon in the 1950s. Dixon, on the other hand, received proper credit as the
                    composer of his two songs on this album (although
                    "You Shook Me" would later be additionally credited to J. B. Lenoir) but would go on to
                    settle out of court with Led Zeppelin over partial use of other material of his on Plant's
                    lyrics to "Whole Lotta Love". On "You
                    Shook Me", Plant vocally mimics Page's guitar effects—a metallicised version of the "call
                    and response" blues technique.

Jeff Beck had previously recorded "You Shook Me"
                    for his album, Truth, and accused Page of
                    stealing his idea. With John Paul Jones and drummer Keith Moon of The Who, Page had played on (and
                    says he arranged) "Beck's Bolero", an instrumental on Truth that would be grooved
                    into the mix of the Led Zeppelin jam "How Many
                    More Times". These cross-pollinations led to a rift between Beck and Page, who had played in
                    the Yardbirds together and been friends since childhood. In fact, it was Page who first suggested
                    Beck for the Yardbirds' guitarist position when
                    he was contacted by the band after Eric Clapton's departure.

In an interview he gave
                    in 1975, Page offered his own perspective on the album's music:

 For material, we
                    obviously went right down to our blues roots. I still
                    had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over. By the time Jeff Beck did go, it was up to me to come up
                    with a lot of new stuff. It was this thing where Eric Clapton set a heavy precedent in the Yardbirds
                    which Beck had to follow and then it was even
                    harder for me, in a way, because the second lead guitarist had suddenly become the first. And I was
                    under pressure to come up with my own riffs. On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the
                    earlier days. I think it tells a bit, too... It was
                    obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we'd have all sat around jamming for six
                    months. But after that, on the second LP, you can really hear the group identity coming together.

Plant
                    is credited on the album with
                    "occasional bass". In an interview he gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 2005, Plant made
                    reference to this:

 In truth, I was an occasional bass player. It says so on Zeppelin I,
                    next to my name: vocals, harmonica and occasional
                    bass. Very occasionally -- once, I think, since 1968. How in God's name that ended up on the
                    cover is so funny. I'm sure Jonesy John Paul Jones didn't like it *laughs*. But I suppose
                    every time he fucked up he could say it was
                    me.

The album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan "Led Zeppelin —
                    the only way to fly". It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, Rolling
                    Stone magazine asserted that the band offered
                    "little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn't say as well or better three months ago
                    ... It would seem that if they are to fil the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to
                    find a producer, editor and some material worthy
                    of their collective talents." It also called Plant "as foppish as Rod Stewart, but nowhere
                    near so exciting". John Paul Jones later recalled:

 We had appalling press at the
                    time. Nobody seemed to want to know us for one reason
                    or another. We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was
                    going on about us as another hyped British band. We couldn't belive it. In our naivety we
                    thought we'd done a good album and were doing all
                    right, and then this venom comes flying out. We couldn't understand why or what we'd done
                    to them. After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation. We
                    avodied them and so they avoided us. It was only
                    because we did a lot of show that our reputation got around as a good live band.

As was
                    noted by rock journalist Cameron Crowe years later: "It was a time of "super-groups,"
                    of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it,
                    and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity."

However,
                    press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing
                    review in the Melody Maker. Chris Welch
                    wrote, in a review titled "Jimmy Page triumphs — Led Zeppelin is a gas!": "their
                    material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the
                    emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues
                    bands".

The album was very commercially successful. It was initially released in
                    America on 17 January 1969 to capitalise on the band's first U.S. concert tour. Before that,
                    Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance
                    white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled
                    with a good reaction to the band's opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000
                    advance orders. Within two months of its release
                    the album had reached Billboard's Top 10. It stayed on the Billboard chart for 73 weeks and
                    held a 79-week run on the British charts. By 1975 it had grossed $7,000,000.

The success
                    and influence of the album is today widely
                    acknowledged, even amongst those critics who were initially skeptical. In 2006, for example, Rolling
                    Stone stated that

 The album was pretty much unlike anything else. The arrangements were
                    more sculpted than those of Cream or Jimi Hendrix,
                    and the musicianship wasn't cumbersome like Iron Butterfly's or bombastic like Vanilla
                    Fudge's. The closest comparisons might be to MC5 or the Stooges—both from Michigan—yet neither
                    had the polish or prowess of Led Zeppelin, nor did
                    Led Zeppelin have the political, social or die-hard sensibility of those landmark bands. What they
                    did have, though, was the potential for a mass audience.

According to Lewis:

 Time
                    has done nothing to diminish the quality of one of
                    the finest debut albums ever recorded. There's an urgency and enthusiasm about their
                    performance that retains timeless charm. The nine cuts offer a tour de force of powerful yet often
                    subtle dynamics ... And let's not forget the fact that
                    with this album, Page virtually invents the guitar riff as a key songwriting component.

In
                    2003, VH1 named Led Zeppelin the 44th greatest album of all time, while Rolling Stone ranked it 29th
                    on the magazine's list of the 500 greatest
                    albums of all time. It is widely regarded as marking a significant turning point in the evolution of
                    hard rock and heavy metal.

"How Many More Times" was listed as 3:30 on the record sleeve
                    deliberately by Jimmy Page in order to trick radio
                    stations into playing the song.citation needed

Robert Plant participated in songwriting but
                    wasn't given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association
                    with CBS Records.

Some cassette
                    versions of the album reversed the order of the sides. For these versions, side one began with
                    "Your Time Is Gonna Come" and ended with "How Many More Times", while side two
                    began with "Good Times, Bad Times" and ended
                    with "Dazed and Confused".

					<content>Physical Graffiti is the sixth album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It is a double
                    album which was released on 24 February 1975. Recording sessions for the album were initially
                    disrupted when John Paul Jones considered leaving the
                    band. After reuniting at Headley Grange, the band wrote and recorded eight songs, the combined
                    length of which stretched the album beyond the typical length of an LP. This prompted the band to
                    make Physical Graffiti a double album by including
                    previously unreleased tracks from earlier recording sessions.

Physical Graffiti was
                    commercially and critically successful; the album is 16 times platinum (though this only signifies
                    sales of 8 million copies, as it is a double album) in the
                    United States alone, and has come to be regarded as one of Led Zeppelin's defining works. In
                    2003, the album was ranked number 70 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest
                    albums of all time.

The album was released on 24
                    February 1975, at a time when Led Zeppelin was undertaking its tenth concert tour of North America.
                    Delays in the production of the album's sleeve design prevented its release prior to the
                    commencement of the tour.

Physical Graffiti was
                    the band's first release on their own Swan Song Records label, which had been launched in May
                    1974. Until this point, all of Led Zeppelin's albums had been released on Atlantic Records. The
                    album was a commercial and critical success,
                    having built up a huge advance order, and when eventually released it reached #1 on Billboard's
                    Pop Albums chart. It has since proven to be one of the most popular releases by the group, selling 8
                    million copies in the United States alone (which
                    has made it 16 times platinum as it is a double album). Physical Graffiti was the first album to go
                    platinum on advance orders alone. Shortly after its release, all previous Led Zeppelin albums
                    simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album
                    chart.

Billboard magazine's 5 star review of the album stated: "[Physical
                    Graffiti] is a tour de force through a number of musical styles, from straight rock to blues to
                    folky acoustic to orchestral sounds." In 1998 Q magazine
                    readers voted Physical Graffiti the 28th greatest album of all time; in 2000 Q placed it at number
                    32 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever; and in 2001 the same magazine named it as
                    one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. In 2003
                    the TV network VH1 named it the 71st greatest album ever. In 2003, the album was ranked number 70 on
                    Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album is also listed
                    in Robert Dimery and Stevie Chick's 1001
                    Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005). &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Physical+Graffiti"&gt;Read

					<content>Presence is the seventh studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released by Swan Song
                    Records on 31 March 1976. The album was written and recorded during a tumultuous time in the band's
                    history, as Robert Plant was recuperating
                    from serious injuries he had sustained in a recent car accident. The album received mixed reviews
                    from critics, and is one of the lowest sellers in the band's catalogue. It was Led Zeppelin's
                    second album to be composed of completely
                    original material, after Houses of the Holy.

This album was conceived after singer Robert
                    Plant sustained serious injuries from a car accident on the Greek island of Rhodes on 5 August 1975,
                    which forced the band to cancel a proposed world
                    tour which was due to commence on 23 August 1975. At this point, Led Zeppelin were arguably at the
                    height of their popularity. Plant recalled:

 I was lying there in some pain trying to get
                    cockroaches off the bed and the guy next to me, this
                    drunken soldier, started singing "The Ocean" from Houses of the Holy.

The cover
                    and inside sleeve of this album, created by Hipgnosis, features various images of people interacting
                    with a black obelisk-shaped object. Inside the
                    album sleeve, the item is referred to simply as "The Object". It was intended to represent
                    the "force and presence" of Led Zeppelin. In the liner notes of the first Led Zeppelin
                    boxed set, Jimmy Page explained:

 There was
                    no working title for the album. The record-jacket designer said `When I think of the group, I always
                    think of power and force. There's a definite presence there.' That was it. He wanted to
                    call it `Obelisk'. To me, it was more
                    important what was behind the obelisk. The cover is very tongue-in-cheek, to be quite honest. Sort
                    of a joke on [the film] 2001. I think it's quite amusing.

The background used in the
                    cover photograph is of an artificial marina that was
                    installed inside London's Earl's Court Arena for the annual Earl's Court Boat Show
                    that was held in the winter of 1974–1975. This was the same venue where the band played a series of
                    concerts a few months after the boat show, in May
                    1975.

In 1977 the album was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album
                    package.

The album was released on 31 March 1976, having been delayed by the completion of
                    the album sleeve. In Britain it attained one of the
                    highest ever advance orders, shipping gold on the day of release. In America it peaked at #1 on
                    Billboard's Pop Albums chart, leaping from #24 inside two weeks. In 1977 the album was
                    nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of best album
                    package.

The album's catalogue numbers were Swan Song SS 8416 in the U.S. and Swan
                    Song SSK59402 in the UK, before being changed to 92439-2 for when the remastered version was
                    released. However, this album has not been one of the
                    band's biggest sellers, and it received somewhat lukewarm reviews upon its release.[7] In late
                    1976 the album was also somewhat overshadowed by the release of the band's movie and soundtrack
                    The Song Remains the Same.

According to
                    Dave Lewis, "the direct-hard hitting nature of the seven recordings failed to connect with a
                    fan base more accustomed to the diversity and experimental edge of their previous work. Indeed, Page
                    later himself acknowledged that, because the album
                    conveys a sense of urgency as a direct result of the troubled circumstances in which it was
                    recorded, "it's not an easy album for a lot of people to access ... It's not an easy
                    album for a lot of people to listen
                    to."

However, despite its initially subdued reception, Lewis considers that Presence
                    has become a much underrated element of their catalogue. The basic drums-bass-guitars formula may
                    lack the diversity of previous Zeppelin sets, but in
                    terms of sheer energy, 'Presence' packs a considerable punch, and has emerged as one of
                    their most potent performances ... This album is also a triumph for Jimmy Page. His production and
                    dominant guitar style has an urgency and passion that
                    reflects the troubled period that the group were going through at the time. 'Presence' is
                    Led Zeppelin with their backs against the wall. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Presence"&gt;Read

				<content>Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name "The New Yardbirds", based on Page's previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited
        Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock
        music. However, the band's individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of "album-oriented
        rock".

Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham's death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million
        albums worldwide, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US,
        with six reaching the number one spot.

Shortly after their first tour, the group's eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal
        records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin's earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as "Communication Breakdown" had a unique and distinctively heavy
        sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on "Black Mountain Side" in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song "Babe I'm
        Gonna Leave You". The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band's career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour. 

The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II, followed in similar
        style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom.

Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the
        Willie Dixon song "You Shook Me", and their later hit "Whole Lotta Love" was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until
        Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given.) 

The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led
        Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight
        workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham).

For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III, the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage
        in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song "Bron-yr-Aur Stomp", misspellt as "Bron-y-Aur Stomp" on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique
        album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin's record label, Atlantic Records, released "Immigrant Song" as a single
        against the band's wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of "Whole Lotta Love" which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, "Hey Hey What Can I Do". Even though the band saw their albums
        as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced
        their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band's preference that their fans hear and see them in person.

Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually
        untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured "Stairway to Heaven", which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar,
        the top neck a twelve-stringed version.

Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham's tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial
        success and influence.

Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged
        series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale. John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of
        a "SuperJam" featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir "?uestlove" Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend. 

Most recently Led Zeppelin
        have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegün. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on
        10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release. Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works.


Awards and
        accolades

Led Zeppelin were honoured by US President Barack Obama at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors
Throughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
        1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their
        recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six
        Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.

Page was appointed an Officer of
        the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest
        Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's "50 best live acts of all time". They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for "Outstanding Contribution to British Music" in 1977, as well as a "Lifetime Achievement Award" at
        the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the "Best Live Act" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the "greatest rock and roll band of all time".
        The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors.

                    often flirted with pop, even recording the first

					<content>It's unfair to say that Fleetwood Mac had no pop pretensions prior to the addition of
                    Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to the lineup in 1975. When they were led by Bob Welch they
                    often flirted with pop, even recording the first
                    version of the unabashedly smooth and sappy "Sentimental Lady," which would later be one
                    of the defining soft rock hits of the late '70s. Still, there's no denying that 1975's
                    Fleetwood Mac represents not just the rebirth of
                    the band, but in effect a second debut for the group -- the introduction of a band that would
                    dominate the sound of American and British mainstream pop for the next seven years. In fact, in
                    retrospect, it's rather stunning how thoroughly
                    Buckingham and Nicks, who had previously recorded as a duo and were romantically entangled in the
                    past, overtook the British blues band. As soon as the Californian duo came onboard, Fleetwood Mac
                    turned into a West Coast pop/rock band, transforming
                    the very identity of the band and pushing the band's other songwriter, keyboardist Christine
                    McVie, to a kindred soft rock sound. It could have all been too mellow if it weren't for the
                    nervy, restless spirit of Buckingham, whose insistent
                    opener, "Monday Morning," sets the tone for the rest of the album, as well the next few
                    years of the group's career. Surging with a pushily melodic chorus and a breezy Californian
                    feel, the song has little to do with anything the Mac
                    had done before this, and it is a positively brilliant slice of pop songwriting, simultaneously
                    urgent and timeless. After that barnstorming opener, Buckingham lies back a bit, contributing only
                    two other songs -- a cover of Richard Curtis'
                    "Blue Letter," the second best up-tempo song here, and the closer, "I'm So
                    Afraid" -- while the rest of the album is given over to the wily spirits of Nicks and McVie,
                    whose singles "Rhiannon," "Say You Love
                    Me," and "Over My Head" deservedly made this into a blockbuster. But a bandmember's
                    contribution can never be reduced to his own tracks, and Buckingham not only gives the production
                    depth, he motivates the rest of the band,
                    particularly Nicks and McVie, to do great work, not just on the hit singles but the album tracks
                    that give this record depth. It was diverse without being forced, percolating with innovative ideas,
                    all filtered through an accessible yet sophisticated
                    sensibility. While Rumours had more hits and Tusk was an inspired work of mad genius, Fleetwood Mac
                    wrote the blueprint for Californian soft rock of the late '70s and was the standard the rest
                    were judged by. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi

					<content>Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. Largely
                    recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut
                    and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros.
                    Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United
                    Kingdom Albums Chart. "Go Your Own Way", "Don't Stop", "Dreams",
                    and "You Make Loving Fun" were released
                    as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with
                    sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries,
                    including the US, UK and Australia.

The band wanted
                    to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with
                    relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by
                    hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac
                    members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's
                    tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process
                    delayed the completion of Rumours, but was
                    finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook
                    worldwide promotional tours.

Rumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred
                    on its production quality and harmonies, which
                    frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of
                    musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has
                    featured in several publications' lists of the best albums
                    of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the
                    addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.

In July
                    1975, Fleetwood Mac's tenth album was
                    released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in
                    1976. The record's hit single "Rhiannon" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At
                    the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted
                    of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist
                    Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop
                    touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of
                    marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters.
                    Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist
                    Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship
                    that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs
                    together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother
                    of his two children, had an affair with his best
                    friend.

Press intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories.
                    Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks
                    were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter
                    Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original
                    Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour.
                    Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up,
                    although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new
                    album began. Fleetwood has noted the "tremendous emotional sacrifices" made by everyone
                    just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood
                    Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense
                    with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on
                    the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called
                    Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.

					<content>Artistically and commercially, the Stevie Nicks/Lindsey Buckingham/Mick Fleetwood/Christine and

                    ended his association with the band on a creative high note. Serving as the album's main
                    producer, Buckingham gives an edgy quality to everything
                    from the haunting "Isn't It Midnight" to the poetic "Seven Wonders" to the
                    dreamy "Everywhere." Though Buckingham doesn't over-produce, his thoughtful use of
                    synthesizers is a major asset. Without question,
                    "Family Man" and "Caroline" are among the best songs ever written by Buckingham,
                    who consistently brings out the best in his colleagues on this superb album. ~ Alex Henderson, Rovi

					<summary>Fleetwood Mac's 1997 concert film The Dance comes to DVD, presenting classics like "Rhiannon,"
                    "The Chain," "Go Your Own Way," and "Tusk," as well as newer songs
                    like "Temporary One" and
                    "Bleed to Love Her" in crystal-clear digital video and Dolby Digital Surround Sound.
                    Though the disc is lacking in special DVD features, such as a discography or biographies, The Dance
                    is a decent DVD that documents one of the '90s
                    most successful comebacks. ~ Heather Phares, Rovi &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/The+Dance"&gt;Read

					<content>More than any other Fleetwood Mac album, Tusk is born of a particular time and place -- it
                    could only have been created in the aftermath of Rumours, which shattered sales records, which in
                    turn gave the group a blank check for its next
                    album. But if they were falling apart during the making of Rumours, they were officially broken and
                    shattered during the making of Tusk, and that disconnect between bandmembers resulted in a
                    sprawling, incoherent, and utterly brilliant 20-track
                    double album. At the time of its release, it was a flop, never reaching the top of the charts and
                    never spawning a true hit single, despite two well-received Top Ten hits. Coming after the
                    monumental Rumours, this was a huge disappointment, but the
                    truth of the matter is that Fleetwood Mac couldn't top that success no matter how hard they
                    tried, so it was better for them to indulge themselves and come up with something as unique as Tusk.
                    Lindsey Buckingham directed both Fleetwood Mac and
                    Rumours, but he dominates here, composing nearly half the album, and giving Christine McVie's
                    and Stevie Nicks' songs an ethereal, floating quality that turns them into welcome respites
                    from the seriously twisted immersions into
                    Buckingham's id. This is the ultimate cocaine album -- it's mellow for long stretches, and
                    then bursts wide open in manic, frantic explosions, such as the mounting tension on "The Ledge"
                    or the rampaging "That's Enough
                    for Me," or the marching band-driven paranoia of the title track, all of which are relieved by
                    smooth, reflective work from all three songwriters. While McVie and Nicks contribute some excellent
                    songs, Buckingham owns this record with his
                    nervous energy and obsessive production, winding up with a fussily detailed yet wildly messy record
                    unlike any other. This is mainstream madness, crazier than Buckingham's idol Brian Wilson and
                    weirder than any number of cult classics. Of
                    course, that's why it bombed upon its original release, but Tusk is a bracing, weirdly
                    affecting work that may not be as universal or immediate as Rumours, but is every bit as classic. As
                    a piece of pop art, it's peerless. ~ Stephen Thomas

				<content>Fleetwood Mac is a British and American blues band formed in 1967. From the band's inception through the end of 1974, no incarnation of Fleetwood Mac lasted longer than two years, but all featured core members Mick Fleetwood and John
        McVie. Their two most successful periods have been during the late 60s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Green, and from 1975 to 1987, when they went a pop-oriented direction with musicians Christine McVie,
        Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks.

The band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with a line-up that included Bob Welch, and also during the 90s, which saw more personnel changes before the return
        of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997. More recently, the departure of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac in 1998 shifted around the group's plans for many years. McVie returned to the fold in 2014 and a coming tour featuring the reunited line-up is
        in the works.

The only member present in the band from the very beginning is its namesake drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bassist John McVie, despite his giving part of his name to the band, did not play on their first single nor at their first
        concerts. Keyboardist Christine McVie has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album 'Kiln House'.

The band was started in London in 1967 by
        guitarist Peter Green, who recruited the rhythm section of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie. Green himself had replaced a departing member, Eric Clapton, as the lead guitarist of the
        "Bluesbreakers;" Green and McVie had appeared on John Mayall's 1967 A Hard Road album. The band employed another bassist, Bob Brunning, until John McVie was persuaded to join the band. (The band's first album Fleetwood Mac
        contains one song with Brunning on bass.) Slide-guitarist and Elmore James devotee, Jeremy Spencer, rounded out the lineup.

After its second album, Mr. Wonderful, a third guitarist, 18-year-old Danny Kirwan, was added to the lineup. At this
        point the band began shifting into a more melodic, introspective, and experimental/progressive mode. Most performances were built around the twin leads of Green and Kirwan, and Kirwan's songwriting was featured in nearly equal proportion to
        Green's. After releasing two successful singles, the instrumental "Albatross" (which remains the band's only #1 hit in the UK), and the ballad "Man of the World" [#2 UK], it produced what is often considered the best
        album of the band's Peter Green era, Then Play On. Spencer was, for the most part, absent from these recording sessions. The epic 2-part "Oh Well" single followed [#2 UK], and was included in later pressings of the U.S. LP album (and
        in all CDs). The band was then rocked by Peter Green's decision to leave. Debate rages on the reasons for this, but it is agreed that Green wished to play a more experimental and improvisational style. Drugs, particularly LSD, also played a
        large part, as Green recorded sporadically before falling into a twenty-year period of mental illness. After a short gap, Christine McVie (a.k.a. under her maiden name Christine Perfect) joined the band on keyboards, and the band moved from the blues
        to a more melodic pop style.

The early 1970s of Fleetwood Mac were turbulent for the band, which gained and lost members at a troubling rate. Jeremy Spencer disappeared during an American tour, and was found to have joined the controversial
        Children of God cult. American guitarist Bob Welch joined up, at the suggestion of good friend Judy Wong, lending a jazz-rock flavor to Kirwan's more melodic songs. Kirwan's and Welch's tenures overlapped by two albums, but eventually,
        Kirwan's own erratic behavior on tour led to his dismissal in late 1972. Welch's contributions included "Future Games" (from 1971's Future Games), "Sentimental Lady" (from 1972's Bare Trees), and
        "Hypnotized" (from 1973's Mystery To Me).

Bob Weston (guitar) and Savoy Brown's Dave Walker (vocals) were also briefly hired during this phase of the band. Walker was fired after just one album, but the firing of Weston,
        for an alleged affair with Mick Fleetwood's wife, during a late 1973 tour led to that tour's abrupt cancellation. This led its manager, Clifford Davis, to send another dummy band out on the road billed as "Fleetwood Mac," but
        featuring no original members of the band, resulting in a year-long legal battle. The fake Fleetwood Mac scored one hit a couple of years later ("Why Did You Do It?") under their new name Stretch

In late 1974, Welch indicated that
        he intended to leave the band, and Fleetwood and John McVie needed to fill the possible vacancy. While Fleetwood was scouting Van Nuys, California's Sound City Studios, house engineer Keith Olsen played a track titled "Frozen Love,"
        which he had mixed there for an obscure American duo, Buckingham Nicks. Fleetwood liked what he heard, and he was introduced to the guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham, who just happened to be in the building. When Welch resigned from the band, Fleetwood
        asked Buckingham to join. Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his musical partner and girlfriend, Stevie Nicks, also become part of the band.

In 1975, under new management by Gabriele Arras, the new lineup released the eponymous
        Fleetwood Mac (otherwise known as The White Album). This proved to be a breakthrough for the band and it became a huge hit. The band was catapulted into stardom. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie's "Over My
        Head" and "Say You Love Me," and Stevie Nicks's "Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win)."

But in 1976, with the success of the band also came the end of John and Christine McVie's marriage, as well as
        Buckingham's and Nicks's longtime romantic relationship. Pressure was put on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-on album, which, when combined with its new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions, fuelled by large
        amounts of drug and alcohol consumption, especially cocaine.

The album the band members created was Rumours in 1977, in which the band lays bare the emotional turmoil experienced at that time. It became the best- selling album of the year,
        and it sold over 19 million copies worldwide by 1998. The RIAA certified Rumours as a diamond album.

This lineup of the band continued to record for over a decade. Their 1979 album Tusk was a double album, more experimental in tone, still
        spawning three hit singles but selling nowhere near the quantity of Rumours. After solo albums by Nicks and Buckingham, 1982's Mirage was a return to more commercial pop, but still didn't reproduce the success of Rumours. The band went on
        hiatus, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham continuing solo careers and Christine McVie issuing a solo album as well.

In 1987, the band reconvened for Tango In The Night, some of which was originally destined for another Buckingham solo
        disc. The disc sold well and had several hit singles, but Buckingham refused to tour with the band and they parted ways acrimoniously. Buckingham was replaced with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette for the Tango In The Night tour, and this new lineup
        recorded the 1990 album Behind The Mask, which did not enjoy much commercial success. In 1991, Nicks and Vito announced they were leaving the band. Bekka Bramlett joined, and this lineup eventually recorded the unsuccessful album Time in
        1995.

In 1997, the "classic" Rumours line-up reunited for an MTV reunion special called The Dance. The live album sold over 5 million copies in the United States and spawned a 40-city tour. Following The Dance, Christine McVie
        retired from the band permanently, and the remaining four (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood) produced a new album released in 2003 called Say You Will. The new album included 18 new songs written by Lindsey Buckingham
        and Stevie Nicks. They then went on an 18-month worldwide tour over the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe.

In interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album, Under The Skin, Buckingham stated that there were plans for
        the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour but recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In a September 2007 interview Stevie Nicks gave to the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, she noted that she is unwilling to carry on
        with the band unless Christine McVie returns. However in a recent interview, Mick Fleetwood said "...be very happy and hopeful that we will be working again. I can tell you everyone's going to be extremely excited about what's
        happening with Fleetwood Mac."

On June 9, 2008, The New York Times reported that Irving Azoff is in the process of negotiating a deal with Wal-Mart for Fleetwood Mac's new album. The article states "Mr. Azoff said that he was
        already talking to Wal-Mart about an exclusive deal for Fleetwood Mac’s next release. 'Classic rock really works there,' Mr. Azoff said."

According to Stevie Nicks, "the group will start working on material and recording
        probably in October, and finish an album."

However, instead of returning to the studio, the band instead went back out on the road in 2009 for a greatest hits tour called "Fleetwood Mac Unleashed," the first time the band have
        gone out on tour without an album to support. The tour saw the band play throughout the United States as well as returning, for the first time in years, to play dates in Canada, Europe, and the UK.

On January 11, 2014, Mick Fleetwood
        announced that Christine McVie would be rejoining Fleetwood Mac, and the news was confirmed on January 13.

					<summary>Yours Truly is the debut studio album by American recording artist Ariana Grande. Formerly
                        titled Daydreamin', the album was released on August 30, 2013 through Republic Records.
                        Incorporating R&amp;B, pop and soul, Yours Truly was
                        influenced by Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse, Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey amongst other
                        of Grande's idols. Grande describes the album's first half as a "throwback"
                        to the R&amp;B music of the 1990s, and the second half
                        being "very unique and very special that I've sort of written" which is

Grande reached mainstream success in March 2013 after
                    her debut single "The Way" (featuring
                    Mac Miller) from her debut studio album Yours Truly (2013), became a Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit.
                    The album debuted atop the Billboard 200 chart.

In August 2014, Grande released her second
                    studio album My Everything, which became her second
                    number one album in the US. Its lead single, "Problem" (featuring Iggy Azalea), reached
                    number two on Billboard Hot 100 and became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. With
                    four Top 10 hit singles from the album, Grande

                    any artist in 2014. All of five singles from My Everything were certified Platinum or better by
                    RIAA.

In May 2016, Grande released her third
                    studio album, Dangerous Woman. It was her first album to not hit number-one on Billboard 200. The
                    lead single, Dangerous Woman, debuted at number 10 on Billboard Hot 100, making Grande the first
                    person in the history of that chart to have the lead
                    single from each of her first three albums debut in the top 10.

Grande has released Holiday
                    music, Christmas Kisses (2013), which included "Santa Tell Me" (2014) in the exclusive
                    re-release in Japan, and Christmas &amp; Chill
                    (2015), which debuted at number thirty-four on Billboard 200 chart with 27,000 digital copies. &lt;a

					<content>19 is the debut studio album by British singer Adele. It was first released on 28 January
                        2008, through XL Recordings. Following Adele's graduation from the BRIT School for
                        Performing Arts &amp; Technology in May 2006, she began
                        publishing songs and recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend. The
                        friend posted the demo on Myspace, where it became very successful and led to interest from XL
                        Recordings. This led to Adele signing a recording contract
                        with the label and providing vocals for Jack Peñate, during this session for Peñate's song
                        she met producer Jim Abbiss, who would go on to produce the majority of her debut album.

Adele
                        wrote most of the album's material solely,
                        but did work with a select few writers and producers including Jim Abbiss, Eg White and Sacha
                        Skarbek. Their collaborations created a blue-eyed soul album with lyrics describing heartbreak
                        and relationship. Upon release, 19 received generally
                        positive reviews from critics, who praised the singer's vocals and noting her as having the
                        "potential to become among the most respected and inspiring international artists of her
                        generation." 19 was also won and was nominated for
                        numerous accolades including a Mercury Prize, and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The
                        second single, "Chasing Pavements" also won the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal
                        Performance at the 51st Annual Grammy Awards.

19 was
                        a commercial success, debuting at number one on the UK charts during its release, and peaking at
                        number four on the US Billboard 200 in 2012. The album is certified 7× Platinum in the UK, and
                        3× Platinum in the US. Worldwide sales for the album are
                        at an estimated 10 million copies. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Adele/19"&gt;Read

					<content>25 is the third studio album recorded by British singer and songwriter Adele. It was
                        released on 20 November 2015, through XL Recordings. Following the release and international
                        success of Adele's second studio album 21, she had planned
                        to quit the music industry and go out on a positive note. However, Adele decided to take a
                        hiatus instead and raise her son. During her sabbatical, she suffered with writer's block
                        and rescheduled the album's studio sessions fearing she had
                        lost her ability to write songs. In 2013, Adele had a breakthrough and the material that
                        eventually became 25 manifested, with writing and recording continuing through to 2015.
                        According to the singer, the album's title is a reflection of her
                        when she was 25 and the frame of mind she was in during that age.

Prior to the album's
                        release, 25 was listed as one of the most anticipated albums of 2015. Billboard, Fuse, SMH and
                        numerous others placed the album at number one on
                        their list, with the latter stating "if Adele releases her third album in 2015, she could
                        dominate the year." Prior to the album's official announcement, music journalists and
                        fans speculated that the album would be titled 25
                        continuing the age theme from Adele's previous releases 19 and 21.

On the eve of
                        her 26th birthday in May 2014, Adele posted a message via her Twitter account which prompted
                        media discussion about her next album. The message, "Bye
                        bye 25... See you again later in the year," was interpreted by outlets including the
                        Billboard and Capital FM as meaning that her next album would be titled 25 and released later in
                        the year.

A release date for 25 was first suggested in
                        early August 2014, when Paul Moss suggested that an album would be released in 2014 or 2015.
                        However, accounts filed by Adele's label XL Recordings in October 2014 ruled out the
                        possibilities of a 2014 release. In August 2015, Billboard reported
                        that Adele's label had intentions of releasing her third studio album sometime in November
                        2015. In October 2015, the album was speculated to be released on 20 November 2015, after which
                        numerous journalists speculated that other musicians had
                        pushed back their albums in order to avoid chart competition with her, with artists such as
                        Justin Bieber, Sam Smith and One Direction releasing their albums before Adele's, so that
                        their sales and chart placements would not be
                        affected.

On 18 October, a 30-second clip of "Hello" was shown on UK
                        television during a commercial break on The X Factor. It teased a new song from Adele after
                        three years, with viewers hearing her singing the first verse of
                        "Hello" with its lyrics appearing on a black screen. It was seen by an estimated 13.4
                        million people. Three days later, Adele released a letter to her fans through social media
                        addressing the album, in which she confirmed that the album
                        would be titled 25.

Adele stated that the title is a reflection on her age and the
                        frame of mind she was in during that age, describing the time as a "turning point"
                        where she was in the centre of adolescence and adulthood and the
                        start of a time where she would "go into becoming who I’m going to be forever without a
                        removal van full of my old junk." Adele confirmed the next day 25 would be released on 20
                        November 2015 and revealed its cover simultaneously on
                        Facebook and Twitter.

The lead single, "Hello", was released on 23 October
                        2015 and became a critical and commercial success, with the single becoming a worldwide number
                        one hit in 16 countries.

Grammy Awards (2017) - At

				<content>Adele Laurie Blue Adkins, (born 5 May 1988), is a multiple Grammy Award-Winning English
                    singer-songwriter from Enfield, North London. Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and
                    entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received
                    four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album
                    included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February
                    2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal
                    Performance. 

Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and
                    propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times
                    Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of
                    4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum
                    status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album
                    has produced three global chart-topping singles thus
                    far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the
                    2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.

Adele
                    graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in
                    May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her
                    talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&amp;R, and hoped to launch other people's
                    careers. Four months later, she published two
                    songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine.com. She had recorded a
                    three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became
                    very successful and led to a phone call from music
                    label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was
                    Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings
                    recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at
                    September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was
                    managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the
                    English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to
                    XL Recordings in September 2006.

Adele's breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was
                    released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Peñate's song, My Yvonne, from his
                    debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT
                    Awards Critics' Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an
                    annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on
                    14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut
                    album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks,
                    finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British
                    charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern
                    Music would name 19 an "essential" Blue Eyed Soul recording.

In June 2013, Adele
                    was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list for services to music.

The
                    much-anticipated third studio album "25"
                    was released on November 20, 2015 on the label XL. The first single from the album, "Hello",
                    was released on Friday, October 23, 2015. 

Grammy Awards (2017) - At the 59th Grammy Awards
                    on Sun, February 12, 2017, Adele took the
                    awards for "Album of The Year" and "Best Pop Vocal Album" for "25".
                    and "Song Of The Year" and "Best Pop Solo Performance" for "Hello".

					<content>Named after the keystroke for making a delta (i.e., triangle) sign on a Mac by holding down
                        the Alt and J keys, the Leeds, England–based trio Alt-J is inspired by the symbol’s mathematical

                        harmony before constructing layered, angular
                        arrangements with sonic ore. Following a dramatic piano part, the opening “Intro” weaves heavily
                        reverberated baritone guitar leads (à la Ennio Morricone) over and around looped beats and
                        random vocal samples that all come together to play like the
                        sons of The Beta Band. These contrast the pointed, geometric arrangements of “Tessellate” with
                        Joe Newman’s flowing, throaty vocals and backing harmonies, which hover above the music like
                        those of Fleet Foxes. Then, in “Breezeblocks”—a mechanically
                        grooving standout in which a toy piano provides the lead—he inflects like Devendra Banhart
                        imitating Jason Mraz, with overt affectation. “Hand Made” closes with folky minimalism. &lt;a

                    2007. The band currently resides in
                    Cambridge.

Unger-Hamilton studied English Literature; the other three Fine Art. In their
                    second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his
                    guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began
                    recording in their dorm rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband. 

First as
                    Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films, they spent the next two years playing around town. Their
                    eponymous first 4-track demo ∆, was recorded with producer
                    Charlie Andrew in London and included early versions of "Breezeblocks", "Hand-Made",
                    "Matilda" and "Tessellate".

Their first 2012 release for Infectious was
                    the triangle shaped 7"
                    "Matilda" / "Fitzpleasure", followed by "Breezeblocks" as an advance

                        style on the album more comparable to Wham!, particularly on songs such as "Treasure"
                        and "When I Was Your Man". Matt Diehl of Rolling
                        Stone compares the disco-influenced "Moonshine" to French electronic duo Daft
                        Punk,[while Allmusic's Tim Sendra calls "If I Knew" a "Sam Cooke-inspired"
                        ballad. &lt;a

                    Right Round by Flo Rida and Wavin' Flag by K'naan.

After the success of the songs
                    he featured on, Mars released his debut EP, It’s Better If You Don’t Understand, in May 2010. 

He
                    then released his debut album, Doo-Wops
                    &amp; Hooligans, on October 5th, which features special guest appearances from B.o.B, Cee-Lo Green,
                    and Damian Marley. The lead single, Just the Way You Are, was released on July 19, 2010. The second
                    single off the album, Grenade, was released on
                    September 2010 as a promotional single but was eventually shifted to official second single. The It
                    Will Rain Songfacts reports that in 2011 he recorded "It Will Rain," the lead single from
                    the soundtrack to the movie The Twilight Saga:
                    Breaking Dawn – Part 1. It was released exclusively on iTunes September 27, 2011.

Bruno
                    Mars was born and raised in the Waikiki neighborhood of Honolulu, Hawaii by parents Pete and
                    Bernadette "Bernie" Hernandez, of Puerto Rican and
                    Filipino descent. Hernandez was one of six children and came from a musical family giving him a
                    diverse mix of reggae, rock, hip hop, and R&amp;B. From a young age, he was impersonating and
                    performing songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis
                    Presley, The Isley Brothers, and The Temptations. In 1990, Hernandez was featured in MidWeek as
                    "Little Elvis", going on to have a cameo in Honeymoon in Vegas in 1992. "I watch the
                    best. I'm a big fan of Elvis. I'm a big fan
                    of 1950s Elvis when he would go on stage and scare people because he was a force and girls would go
                    nuts! You can say the same thing for Prince or The Police. It's just guys who know that people
                    are here to see a show, so I watch those guys and
                    I love studying them because I'm a fan," he stated.

In 2010 he said, "Growing
                    up in Hawaii made me the man I am. I used to do a lot of shows in Hawaii with my father's band.
                    Everybody in my family sings, everyone plays
                    instruments. My uncle's an incredible guitar player, my dad's an incredible percussionist,
                    my brother's a great drummer, he actually plays in our band. I've just been surrounded by
                    it." He attended President Theodore
                    Roosevelt High School, graduating in 2003 at the age of seventeen, and shortly after moved to Los
                    Angeles, California to pursue a musical career.

Before becoming a successful solo artist,
                    Hernandez was an acknowledged music producer, writing
                    songs for Alexandra Burke, Travie McCoy, Adam Levine, Brandy, and Sean Kingston, as well as Flo Rida's
                    international hit "Right Round". He also co-wrote the Sugababes' hit song "Get
                    Sexy" and provided backing vocals on
                    their album Sweet 7. His first musical appearance as a singer was in Far East Movement's second
                    studio album Animal, featured on the track "3D". He reached prominence as a solo artist
                    after being featured on and co-writing B.o.B's
                    "Nothin' on You" and Travie McCoy's "Billionaire"; both songs peaked
                    within the top ten of many charts worldwide. He said of them, "I think those songs weren't
                    meant to be full-sung songs. If I'd sung all
                    of "Nothin' on You", it might've sounded like some '90s R&amp;B."
                    Following this success, Mars released his debut extended play (EP), titled It's Better If You
                    Don't Understand, on May 11, 2010. The EP peaked
                    at the ninety-ninth position on the Billboard 200 and produced one single: "The Other Side",
                    featuring rappers Cee Lo Green and B.o.B. He performed a medley of "Nothin' on You"
                    and "Airplanes" with B.o.B and Hayley
                    Williams at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.

He opened for Maroon 5
                    on the fall leg of the Hands All Over Tour which began on October 6, 2010. Mars also co-headlined
                    with Travie McCoy on a European tour that started on
                    October 18, 2010.

On September 19, 2010, Mars was arrested in Las Vegas for possession of
                    cocaine. He claims "he has never used drugs before" and his decision was "foolish".

He
                    has been nominated for seven 2011
                    Grammy Awards. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars"&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

					<content>Fortune is the fifth studio album by American recording artist Chris Brown, released on
                        June 29, 2012. The album is Brown's first release through RCA Records, following the
                        disbandment of Jive Records in October 2011. As the executive
                        producer of the album, Brown collaborated with several record producers, including The
                        Underdogs, Polow da Don, Brian Kennedy, The Runners, The Messengers, Danja and Fuego, among
                        others. The album also features several guest appearances, including
                        Big Sean, Wiz Khalifa, Nas, Kevin McCall, Sevyn and Sabrina Antoinette. Originally scheduled for
                        release six months after F.A.M.E. (2011), Fortune received several push backs.

Upon its
                        release, Fortune received generally negative reviews
                        from music critics, who panned its songwriting and music. In the United States, the album
                        debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling 135,000 copies in its first week. The album
                        also debuted at number one in the Netherlands, New Zealand and
                        United Kingdom, and reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, Japan and
                        Switzerland.

Preceding the album's release was the lead single "Turn Up the
                        Music", which reached number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100,
                        and number one on the UK Singles Chart. "Sweet Love" and "Till I Die" were
                        released as the album's second and third singles, respectively. "Don't Wake Me Up"
                        was released as the fourth single and reached the
                        top ten in several international countries. "Don't Judge Me" was released as the
                        fifth single from Fortune. To promote the album, Brown made several award show and televised
                        appearances across America.

                    Santana. The album also produced two other top ten singles: "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)" and
                    "Say Goodbye." Brown's second studio
                    album, Exclusive was released worldwide in November 2007. It has spawned his second US number one
                    hit, "Kiss Kiss" which was produced by T-Pain, who was also featured in the song . The
                    third single, "With You", has reached number
                    2 on the Billboard Hot 100, and has entered into the top ten in several countries across the world,
                    becoming one of his most successful worldwide releases to date.

The second single, "Kiss
                    Kiss", was nominated for the 50th Annual
                    Grammy Awards in the category for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration.

Brown, one of two children,
                    was born and raised in the small town of Tappahannock, Virginia, the son of Joyce Hawkins and
                    Clinton Brown. Brown was influenced by the artists his
                    parents played on the home radio, such as Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke. A dancer since the age of
                    two, Brown was not aware of his vocal talents until the age of eleven. Before becoming a vocalist,
                    he was interested in becoming a rapper.

At
                    thirteen, Brown was discovered by a local production team who visited his father's gas station
                    searching for new talent. Since then, he began his recording career and moved to New York, staying
                    there for two years. Brown's local production
                    team organized an audition before Def Jam Vice President Tina Davis, who currently works as his
                    manager. At the age of 15, Brown was then sent to perform for L.A. Reid and was subsequently signed
                    in 2004 to Jive Records. By early 2005, Brown began
                    work for his debut album, working with the likes of Scott Storch, The Underdogs, Dre, Vidal, Bryan
                    Michael Cox, Bow Wow, and Jermaine Dupri.

Brown left school in late 2004 to begin working
                    on his self-titled debut album which was released on
                    November 29, 2005. The album debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200 selling over 155,000 copies in first
                    week of sales. Five weeks later, became certified platinum, and within a year, went double platinum.
                    His debut single "Run It!," was #1 in
                    the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. Following "Run It!," "Yo (Excuse Me
                    Miss)" became Brown's second top 10 hit in the US, peaking at #7, and #13 in the UK. It
                    has been certified platinum by the RIAA.

His
                    third single "Gimme That" was released in March 2006 which featured Lil Wayne for a remix,
                    originally not featured on the Chris Brown album, but was later included. The single debuted on the
                    U.S. Billboard Hot 100 at #80 and climbed the
                    charts quickly peaking at #15. Chris also co-directed his music videos for "Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"
                    and "Gimme That." His fourth single is the ballad "Say Goodbye," which is also a
                    part of the Step Up Soundtrack. On June
                    13, 2006, Brown released a DVD entitled, Chris Brown's Journey, which shows footage of him
                    travelling in England and Japan, getting ready for his first visit to the Grammys, behind the scenes
                    of his music videos and bloopers.

On August
                    17, 2006 to further promote the album, Brown kicked off his major co-headlining tour, The Up Close
                    and Personal Tour. Due to the tour, production for his next album was pushed back two months a

                    the songs "Kiss Kiss" and "With You". Exclusive has gone on to sell over three
                    million copies. 

Graffiti was released in 2009 and included the top-twenty single "I

					<summary>"Awaken, My Love!" is the third studio album by American hip hop artist Childish
                        Gambino, released on December 2, 2016[2] by Glassnote Records.[3] The album's release was
                        preceded by two lead singles, "Me and Your
                        Mama" and "Redbone." Consisting of tracks largely sung rather than rapped, its
                        retro fusion of psychedelic soul, funk and R&amp;B influences was considered a bold departure
                        from the predominately hip hop style of his prior work. &lt;a

                    on the NBC sitcom Community. After several
                    self-released albums and mixtapes, Glover signed to Glassnote Records in 2011 as Childish Gambino.
                    He released Camp on Glassnote on November 15, 2011. His second studio album, Because the Internet,
                    was released on December 10, 2013. Glover was

                    Performance for his single "3005".

Glover was born at Edwards Air Force Base,
                    California and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia. His
                    mother, Beverly (Smith, is a retired daycare provider, and his father, Donald, Sr., is a retired
                    postal worker. His parents also served as DeKalb County foster parents for 14 years. He was raised a
                    Jehovah's Witness. He was voted "Most
                    Likely to Write for The Simpsons" in his High School yearbook. Glover graduated from New York
                    University's Tisch School of the Arts with a degree in dramatic writing in 2006.

From
                    2006 to 2009, Glover was a writer for the NBC
                    series 30 Rock where he also had occasional cameo appearances. He was presented the Writers Guild of
                    America Award for Best Comedy Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the third season.
                    Glover's stage name, Childish Gambino, came
                    from the Wu-Tang Clan's name generator. On June 5, 2008, he released an independent album,
                    titled Sick Boi. Glover would then become a member of the sketch comedy group Derrick Comedy, along
                    with Dominic Dierkes, Meggie McFadden, DC Pierson, and
                    Dan Eckman. The group wrote and starred in a feature-length film, Mystery Team, released in theaters
                    in 2009.

On September 17, 2009, Childish Gambino released the independent album Poindexter.
                    A pair of mixtapes, titled I Am Just a Rapper
                    and I Am Just A Rapper 2 were released, in close succession in 2010. Robert Scahill added his
                    producing expertise helping with the majority of the tracks. The track listings for those mixtapes
                    consist of the name of the song "he" raps,
                    followed by the song he raps over. His second album, Culdesac, was set to be released on July 2,
                    2010, but a couple of last minute additions caused the album to be delayed for a day. The album was
                    made available on July 3. Glover has stated in
                    interviews that on Sick Boi and Poindexter he felt he had to hide behind gimmicks, such as pink
                    hoodies, but with his subsequent projects, he has touched on more personal subject matter, including
                    family, schoolyard bullying, troubled romantic
                    relationships, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. He has disowned his 2005 album, The Younger I Get,
                    as the too-raw ramblings of what he calls a "decrepit Drake."

Glover's
                    stand-up special aired on Comedy Central on March 19,
                    2010. In May 2010, a fan suggested Glover for the role of Peter Parker in the then-upcoming The
                    Amazing Spider-Man film, encouraging his supporters to retweet the hashtag "#donald4spiderman".
                    The campaign, originally started to see how far
                    social networking could carry a message, quickly gained a large following. The call for Glover to be
                    allowed to audition for the role was supported by Spider-Man creator Stan Lee. Glover was not
                    awarded an audition and the role instead went to Andrew
                    Garfield. He would later reveal that he was never contacted by anyone from Sony Pictures for the
                    role. Comics writer Brian Michael Bendis, who announced an African-American version of Spider-Man a
                    year later, said he had conceived of the character
                    before Glover's campaign went viral. Bendis gave credit to Glover for influencing the new hero's
                    looks for Spider-man after seeing him dressed as Spider-Man on Community (a nod to the campaign),
                    Bendis said, "I saw him in the costume
                    and thought, 'I would like to read that book.'" Glover would later voice this
                    incarnation of Spider-Man on the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series.

Glover received the
                    Rising Comedy Star award at the Just for Laughs festival
                    in July 2010. Glover was featured in Gap's 2010 Holiday ad campaign. He DJs and produces
                    electronic music under the moniker "mcDJ" (pronounced "M-C-D-J"). His music is
                    often made available for free download via his
                    website.[citation needed]

On December 1, 2010, Glover released the first track off of his
                    EP titled "Be Alone". He released the next track, "Freaks and Geeks", as well as
                    a five-song track list, on February 11, 2011. On
                    February 25, Glover released the dates for the IAMDONALD tour and also his very first music video
                    for "Freaks and Geeks". The music video was shot by Dan Eckman, the director of the
                    Derrick Comedy troupe. This song was later used in an
                    Adidas commercial featuring Dwight Howard. On March 8, 2011 Glover released the EP via his official
                    website.

On March 16, 2011, Glover hosted the mtvU Woodie Awards held live at South By
                    Southwest. On March 24, 2011, Glover taped his
                    one-hour comedy special Weirdo for Comedy Central; it aired on November 19.

Glover appeared
                    at the 2011 Bonnaroo Music Festival on June 9 in the 'This Tent' as Childish Gambino and
                    June 11 at 'The Comedy Theater' with
                    Bill Bailey performing stand up. Comedy Central streamed the comedy live on their website.

On
                    May 4, 2011, in an interview with TheHipHopUpdate, Glover revealed that he was working on an LP, to
                    be released in September. On July 25, 2011,
                    Glover announced that his new album would be titled Camp. On October 8, during his Orlando, Florida
                    concert, he announced Camp would be released on November 15, 2011. Glover worked with friend and
                    film composer Ludwig Göransson on the debut
                    album.[28] On August 20, 2011, at the Los Angeles Rock The Bells concert, he gave an interview to
                    AllHipHop.com, and he announced to the crowd that he had signed with Glassnote Records. On September
                    20, his first official single, "Bonfire",
                    was released.

The IAMDONALD tour made 24 stops in 34 days, beginning with Ames, Iowa, on
                    April 16, and finishing with Minneapolis on May 19. In between, this included stops at music venues
                    in Las Vegas, Houston, Washington, and Atlanta. The
                    tour was a one-man live show that consisted of rap, comedy, and video segments.

The Sign-Up
                    Tour was Glover's next pre-album tour. He visited 11 cities over the course of 38 days in
                    October and November 2011. Glover made a website for
                    the tour called Camp Gambino on November 19, four days after his album released. The tour featured
                    special guest Danny Brown and made 20 stops during the course of 32 days along a dates in California
                    in December. On March 14, 2012, several dates on
                    the CAMP tour were postponed due to a fractured foot Glover suffered on March 10, while performing
                    in Tampa, Florida. The tour began in Austin, Texas on April 5 and ended August 10 in Hollywood,
                    California.

On January 11, 2012, Childish
                    Gambino announced on his website that a new mixtape would be coming out soon. On April 2, he
                    released a new song, "Eat Your Vegetables", through his website. On May 14, Funkmaster
                    Flex premiered "Unnecessary," featuring Schoolboy
                    Q. On May 16, Gambino released "We Ain't Them" through his website, produced by
                    himself and frequent collaborator Ludwig. On May 22, Glover appeared on Das Racist's radio show
                    "Chillin' Island" where he premiered a
                    new song, "Tell Me," which featured Himanshu Suri, aka Heems from Das Racist. On May 26,
                    Glover released "Black Faces", featuring Nipsey Hussle and produced by Boi-1da. On May 30,
                    he released a third track, "Silk
                    Pillow," featuring Beck and produced by both Glover and Beck. On June 25, Glover revealed that
                    the mixtape was to be released on July 4, 2012. On June 26, Glover premiered another new track, on
                    Sway in the Morning (on Shade 45), entitled
                    "One Up," featuring his brother, Steve G. Lover. That same day, Glover stated that the
                    mixtape would be titled Royalty despite previous statements that it would not be called that. On
                    July 4, 2012, Glover released Royalty for free via
                    digital download. On July 7, 2012, Gambino released the track, "Body," featuring Prodigy,
                    which did not make the cut for the mixtape. On July 24, 2012, he released the music video for "Fire
                    Fly" through his VEVO account on
                    YouTube.

On August 21, 2012, BBC Radio 1 premiered Leona Lewis' new song, "Trouble"
                    off her upcoming album Glassheart, which features Childish Gambino. The song was available for
                    purchase via iTunes on October 7, and peaked at
                    #7 on the UK Singles Chart the following week, making it his first UK top 10 single.] On November 4,
                    2012 Ludwig Göransson said in an interview with Portable that he and Glover were in his studio
                    coming up with new ideas for the next album which was
                    to be "bigger" and "with more people involved."

In 2013, Glover signed
                    on to create a music-themed show for FX titled Atlanta in which he will star, write, and executive
                    produce. Consequently, Glover decided to reduce his
                    work for NBC, and only appears in the first five episodes of Community's 13-episode fifth
                    season. Although many TV stations were interested in picking up his half-hour comedy, he ultimately
                    picked FX due to their willingness to work around his
                    touring schedule.

On October 6, 2013, Glover announced on Twitter that his second studio
                    album was completed. He further announced this at Homecoming Week at Penn State University, stating
                    “I got a new album coming out soon, so this is the
                    last time we’re gonna play a lot of this shit.” On October 8, 2013, he announced its title as
                    Because the Internet and revealed that it would be released in December 2013. On October 21, 2013,
                    Glover released the first single "3005", and
                    announced a release date for the album as December 10, 2013. On February 15, 2014, the rapper
                    launched his Deep Web Tour in the UK. On February 27, Childish Gambino was scheduled to begin the
                    United States portion of his tour with a gig at the Fox
                    Theater in Oakland, California. On June 6, 2014, RIAA certified Heartbeat Gold - making it Glover's
                    first certification, and then on July 18, 2014, RIAA also certified 3005 Gold, making it Glover's
                    second certification.

On October
                    2, 2014, he released a new mixtape titled STN MTN, and the next day he released an EP titled Kauai.
                    The mixtape and the EP follow the story that was last told in Because The Internet and are meant to
                    be a joint project instead of separate
                    projects.

On October 10, 2014, Ubisoft revealed that they had collaborated with Glover to
                    incorporate his song, "Crawl" into Far Cry 4.

On December 5, 2014 Glover was
                    nominated for two Grammy Awards. He was a contender for
                    Best Rap Album for Because The Internet (Glassnote Records) and Best Rap Performance for his single,
                    “3005.”

On March 21, 2015 Glover won an mtvU Woodies Award for Best Video Woodie for the
                    song "Sober" from the Kauai
                    EP.

As of February 2016, Because The Internet has been certified gold by the Recording
                    Industry Association of America for shipping over 500,000 copies. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Childish+Gambino"&gt;Read

					<summary>Ten Thousand Fists is the third studio album by American rock band Disturbed. It was
                        released on September 20, 2005. It became Disturbed's second straight #1 debut on the
                        Billboard 200 chart as well as their second #1 album in New
                        Zealand. It is the first Disturbed album to not feature a Parental Advisory label (despite some
                        minor profanity) as well as being the first Disturbed album to feature John Moyer as the bass
                        player instead of longtime bassist and founding member Steve
                        "Fuzz" Kmak. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed/Ten+Thousand+Fists"&gt;Read

1) Disturbed was formed in 1996
                    when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve Kmak, and Mike Wengren
                    hired singer David Draiman in Chicago, Illinois. They have sold over 11 million albums worldwide,
                    and released four consecutive #1 debuts a feat achieved by only two other rock bands in the history
                    of the chart: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band.
                    Originally classified as a nu metal band, Disturbed is now regarded by some music critics as hard
                    rock or heavy metal, although others now regard them as nu metal. However, the band's genre is
                    still being debated. When asked about die-hard metal
                    fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated:

"We probably
                    have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love
                    that type of music, it's not what we try to do.
                    If we have to place things in context, we're more hard rock than heavy metal these days."

Early
                    Days, The Sickness
In their early years, Disturbed started recording several demos and played
                    live shows. Not long after, in 2000,
                    the band released their debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The
                    song Down With the Sickness became extremely popular and was later used in many film soundtracks.
                    Soon after the release of "The Sickness",
                    Disturbed released a revamped cover version of "Stone Cold" Steve Austin's theme
                    music for WWF called "Glass Shatters". Disturbed headlined the Ozzfest tour in 2001
                    alongside Black Sabbath, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Papa
                    Roach, Linkin Park, Black Label Society, and Crazy Town. Afterward, the band started their own tour,
                    called Music as a Weapon. The bands Adema, Drowning Pool, Stereomud, and Systematic were featured on
                    the tour alongside Disturbed.

Before
                    joining Marilyn Manson's 2001 European tour, Disturbed's bassist Steve "Fuzz"
                    Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle. Fuzz injured his ankle by falling
                    out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's
                    rehearsal hall in Chicago a few days before Christmas. He took the fire escape to exit the building
                    while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. After a successful operation,
                    doctors highly recommended that he skip the tour
                    to avoid more severe damage to his foot. Kmak did perform with the band on January 11th and 12th of
                    2001 in Chicago however. A bass player named Marty O'Brian was recruited and filled Fuzz's
                    spot until Fuzz was able to play again. On June
                    4, 2002, Disturbed released a "documentary" about the band titled M.O.L., which showed
                    some of the bands more personal moments in the studio and during tours.


Believe
In
                    September 2002, Disturbed released their second
                    studio album titled Believe, which debuted at #1. The songs Prayer, Liberate and Remember all became
                    singles and many fans were impressed with the new album, despite it being less aggressive than their
                    debut. The music video for "Prayer"
                    was pulled from most TV stations due to the similarities it had with the September 11, 2001 attacks.
                    Disturbed's front man, David Draiman, recorded the vocals for Forsaken, a track written and
                    produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn for the
                    Queen of the Damned soundtrack. In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and
                    started another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and
                    Unloco toured with them.

In early 2003,
                    after Disturbed had finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, the band experienced the departure of
                    bassist Fuzz, who was excused from the group due to "personal differences." He was
                    replaced with Matt Konopinski very briefly, and then John
                    Moyer, who is now the current bass player.


Ten Thousand Fists
Disturbed toured
                    with 10 Years and Ill Niño in support of their third album Ten Thousand Fists, released worldwide on
                    September 20, 2005, which also debuted at #1 in
                    North America. Ten Thousand Fists had five B-side tracks that were not released on the album, but
                    rather on various singles and other albums. Currently the track "Hell" can be found on the
                    "Stricken" single (a second version of
                    this single has the studio version of the track "Dehumanized", which was originally
                    featured as a live track on the Music as a Weapon II live album and DVD). The track can also be
                    heard on the band's MySpace page. The track
                    "Monster" was originally released as part of an iTunes pre-order package for the first
                    people who pre-ordered Ten Thousand Fists. Afterwards, the track was very hard to find. But, it can
                    now be found on the "Tour Edition" of Ten
                    Thousand Fists (along with the track "Two Worlds"). The track "Sickened" can be
                    found on the "Land of Confusion" single. The fifth and final track "Criminal"
                    has been released on the band's newest album
                    Indestructible. A month after the release of Ten Thousand Fists, Disturbed headlined the
                    Jägermeister tour along with the band Corrosion of Conformity.

Disturbed supplied the song
                    "Stricken" for WWE's New Year's
                    Revolution 2006. In April 2006, the band completed an Australian tour supporting KoRn and sharing
                    the tour with 10 Years and Hatebreed. In mid 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved
                    twice due to David Draiman having troubles with his
                    voice.

In late 2006, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his
                    voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road.
                    Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with Ozzy Osbourne,
                    System of a Down, Dragon Force, Avenged Sevenfold, Lacuna Coil, and Hatebreed. The band also went on
                    the European tour that had been previously moved twice earlier in 2006. Disturbed headlined another
                    one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon
                    III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them.


Dave Draiman and
                    RIAA
Draiman became involved in the music file sharing controversy by publicly speaking out
                    against the RIAA's lawsuits against filesharing
                    individuals, despite the fact his record label is a member of the RIAA.

"This is not
                    rocket science. Instead of spending all this money litigating against kids who are the people they're
                    trying to sell things to in the first place,
                    they have to learn how to effectively use the Internet. For the artists, my ass...I didn't ask
                    them to protect me, and I don't want their protection." - Draiman.

Draiman told
                    NYRock:
"I'm Very positive about the
                    internet, Napster. I think it's a tremendous tool for reaching many more people than we ever
                    could without it. When you release music you want it to be heard by people. Artists really want to
                    have their music heard. They want to have their
                    creation heard by people. Nothing is going to do that better than Napster. I can't tell you how
                    many kids have come up to me and said, 'I downloaded a couple of tunes off Napster and I went
                    out and bought the album.' Or they say,
                    'I want to come see you play.' I don't really make money off of record sales anyway."


Indestructible
                    to Present (2007 - 2009)
Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in
                    Australia on
                    June 7, 2008 and became the band's third consecutive number-one debut on the Billboard 200. A
                    special "Internet Only" limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track "Run",
                    a making-of DVD with instructional
                    videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website
                    with exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released. The band toured in support of the
                    "Mayhem Festival" alongside Slipknot,
                    DragonForce, and Mastodon during summer of 2008. Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and
                    New Zealand through August and September 2008.

The band began their Music as a Weapon IV
                    tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour,
                    also dubbed a "festival", featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira
                    on the main stage.


Asylum (2010–2011)

In an earlier interview, David Draiman
                    briefly talked about the band's fifth studio
                    album, stating that the album will be as dark as their previous album, Indestructible, if not
                    darker. Song-writing for the fifth studio album began in late 2009. In an earlier interview with
                    Mike Wengren and John Moyer, it was stated that, judging by
                    Draiman's feelings on the last few years of his life, that Disturbed's new album will be
                    aggressive, angry, and "hard-hitting", but will be similar musically to their album
                    Believe. Wengren also said that the new album may be
                    released in the spring or summer of 2010. Additionally, Draiman has confirmed that a DVD is in the
                    works. A countdown clock appeared on the band's website, which ended on January 12, 2010 at
                    5:00 p.m. EST, and a trailer for the upcoming DVD,
                    titled Decade of Disturbed, was revealed.

In a July 2009 interview with FaceCulture,
                    Draiman stated that the upcoming DVD will be "chronicling the past decade of Disturbed's
                    existence. It's meant to show our growth over the
                    course of the decade." He also talked more about the upcoming fifth album: "A couple of
                    them [song riffs] that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they're just little
                    pieces...it's not even in two-three part progression
                    [yet]."

A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their
                    debut album, The Sickness, with the B-side tracks God of the Mind and A Welcome Burden, as well as
                    updated artwork. It will also be available for the
                    first time in vinyl format.

On February 8, 2010, it was announced that the band had entered
                    the studio in Chicago, Illinois to begin recording their fifth album, tentatively set for a summer
                    2010 release. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that
                    the band has around 15 to 18 songs for the new album.

On April 20, 2010, roughly two months
                    after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and
                    were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles,
                    California. As they did with their last album Indestructible, Disturbed stated that they
                    self-produced Asylum. The band announced that Asylum would be released on August 31, 2010. On July
                    9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band's
                    official website. Asylum debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200.


The Lost Children
                    and hiatus (2011–2014)

In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after
                    finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview
                    that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the upcoming hiatus was a result of conflict
                    between the band members, saying, "This is really not due to any animosity. I want to make that
                    very clear. In fact, we just had dinner together last
                    night. Believe me, it's not like we can't work with each other any more or we don't
                    get along. This isn't a bad blood thing, and I don't ever want people to get that
                    impression of it." Disturbed went into hiatus in
                    October 2011.

Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled The Lost Children, on
                    November 8, 2011. 

On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer is Heavy Metal
                    supergroup Adrenaline Mob's new bass player. John
                    made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City’s Hiro Ballroom, a day before
                    the release of the band's debut full-length album, Omertá. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate
                    Record Store Day, Disturbed released "The
                    Collection". It is a box set featuring the band's five full length studio albums in 140
                    gram vinyl LPs. In May 2012 Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called
                    Device. Draiman has released information regarding the
                    future of Disturbed and his new project Device. He has stated that Device will release their
                    self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album will feature many guest musicians from various
                    metal bands. Donegan, guitarist for Disturbed, also stated
                    to a journalist for MTV that the future for Disturbed was unclear. "I don't have a clear
                    answer [about the band's future], because I'm not sure where everybody's head's
                    at at the moment other than we're having a
                    great time out on tour, we're going out big, we're carrying big production, we wanna end
                    this on a big note," he said. "I think we're not ready to sit down and have the
                    discussions of when we wanna get back together or if
                    we're gonna. So we're kind of winging it."

On April 25, 2013, it was
                    announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans
                    Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut
                    album, Life by Design? was released on July 23.

Immortalized (2015-present)

On
                    August 21, 2015, Disturbed released their sixth studio album Immortalized. Bassist John Moyer was
                    not available to record the album, so guitarist Dan
                    Donegan had to perform all the basslines. The album debuted on top of the Billboard 200 and went
                    gold within a year. Immortalized produced three #1 hits on rock radio, "The Vengeful One",
                    "The Light", and "The Sound of
                    Silence" (a cover of the classic Simon &amp; Garfunkel track. "The Sound of Silence"
                    became Disturbed's biggest hit on the Hot 100, peaking at #42 and going platinum.

2) Late 80's Thrash band who released the album
                    Disturbing the Peace in 1988.

"Cool crossover/thrash metal. The music takes off quite
                    a few times, especially when it comes up with contrasting
                    mixtures, like "Comatose", which blends heavy doomy riffage with brutal death-tinged
                    outbursts; there are also some undeveloped, but intriguing attempts at more technical thrash (the
                    instrumental "Brain Deth", the sophisticated
                    technical "Productive Intercourse Serial Killer"), spiced with some jolly, rock'n
                    roll hooks. The shorter numbers are pure unbridled hardcore ("Kill 'Em"), but here
                    come the laid-back, soft moments ("Bought &amp;
                    Sold", "Die Die Die"), and things are well balanced. "Evil Sensations" is a
                    pleasant surprise near the end, being energetic thrash/crossover, with a nice technical twist,
                    followed by the melodic, but interesting instrumental
                    "Astronomically", leaving very good impression, partially ruined by the aggressive
                    hardcore closer "What The Fuck". The band disliked the popularity that a novelty song like
                    WTF produced, and it WAS a fan favorite but largely
                    dropped from their live set in the 1990s. Due in part to the lyrics and how the band felt about the
                    song. The band was formed in Minneapolis, MN but toured extensively all over, including the stomping
                    grounds of the later Disturbed; Chicago! They
                    played Jack Koshick's Milwaukee MetalFest in it's earliest days and supported Sepultura
                    and Pestilence on tour, as well as Death and Sadus, and local legends IMPALER. Earl passed away in
                    2008, he is missed by all who knew him, and his
                    MySpace page remains testament. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Disturbed"&gt;Read

					<content>Although ELO quickly became Jeff Lynne’s baby, it was launched as a collaboration between Lynne
                    and his band-mates in The Move, multi-instrumentalist Roy Wood, and drummer Bev Bevan.

Most
                    histories claim that the initial idea for
                    the spin-off group combining rock and classical music was Wood’s, not Lynne’s. Wood and Lynne split
                    the song writing duties on Electric Light Orchestra, much as they did on late-period Move albums,
                    but it seems like their visions of what ELO was were
                    widely divergent. 

Wood’s songs are clearly more classically influenced, with the string
                    and horn sections driving the songs rather than merely colouring them, as they do on Lynne’s tunes.
                    The difference between Wood’s baroque “Look at Me
                    Now” and Lynne’s hard rocking “10538 Overture” is obvious, and Lynne never wrote anything as purely
                    classical as Wood’s “The Battle of Marston Moor (July 2nd, 1644)” in his entire career. (The
                    Gershwin-like piano jazz of “Manhattan Rumble (49th
                    Street Massacre)” is Lynne’s equivalent piece, and suggests an intriguing avenue he unfortunately
                    never explored further.) This dichotomy makes Electric Light Orchestra in some ways much more
                    interesting than later ELO albums. When Wood left to form
                    Wizzard after the release of this album, the tension generated by that clear difference between his
                    and Lynne’s song writing styles was gone.

Later ELO albums were much more commercially
                    successful, but they were also considerably more
                    stylistically attenuated. As good as they are, all of the later ELO albums sound pretty much exactly
                    alike. Electric Light Orchestra sounds like nothing either Jeff Lynne or Roy Wood did before or
                    after, and therein lies its fascination.

					<summary>ELO's fifth studio LP was released in 1975 (see 1975 in music) and the first to be
                    recorded in Musicland Studios Munich. The band featured yet another new line-up with bassist Kelly
                    Groucutt and cellist Melvyn Gale replacing Mike de
                    Albuquerque and Mike Edwards respectively.
The back cover of the record sleeve shows the members
                    of the band with their faces pressed against a glass panel, supposedly watching the "electrocution"
                    depicted on the front cover. &lt;a

					<content>ELO's fifth studio LP was released in 1975 (see 1975 in music) and the first to be
                    recorded in Musicland Studios Munich. The band featured yet another new line-up with bassist Kelly
                    Groucutt and cellist Melvyn Gale replacing Mike de
                    Albuquerque and Mike Edwards respectively.
The back cover of the record sleeve shows the members
                    of the band with their faces pressed against a glass panel, supposedly watching the "electrocution"
                    depicted on the front cover. The band
                    member who is looking away is Richard Tandy, who thought it was a sick idea and therefore didn't
                    want to participate.[1] New member Kelly Groucutt sang lead vocals on "Poker" as well as
                    one of the verses in "Nightrider."
                    (Usually, Jeff Lynne sang all lead vocals for ELO.)
Singles:
The singles "Evil Woman"
                    and "Strange Magic" were the most commercial songs they had recorded up to that point.
                    "Evil Woman" was a big hit in the UK
                    and the US, embracing disco rhythms while still embodying ELO's classic sound.
"Nightrider"
                    became the second single from the album and despite an appearance on the UK Chart show Top of the
                    Pops it failed to chart.
Despite the
                    success of the singles, the LP failed to chart in the UK. However, the album was the band's
                    first to reach Platinum sales and laid the groundwork for future world success. The album was
                    remastered and released in September 2006 with bonus
                    tracks.
Backmasking:
"Fire On High" contains a backwards message in the beginning.
                    When the song is played backwards, the message voiced by drummer Bev Bevan can be heard stating,
                    "The music is reversible, but time is not. Turn
                    back. Turn back. Turn back. Turn back." — ostensibly Jeff Lynne's shot at backmasking
                    hysteria, after satanic allegations were made against their song "Eldorado" by
                    Fundamentalist Christianity members.[2] "Down Home
                    Town" also starts with some backmasking: the refrain from "Waterfall" ("Face the
                    mighty waterfall, face the mighty waterfall"). A portion of the string crescendo from "Nightrider"
                    was used backwards on "Evil
                    Woman."

                    although Mik Kaminski returned to play his famous "blue violin." The live line-up was
                    completed with Louis Clark and newcomer Dave Morgan(guitar, synthesizers, vocals) playing the string
                    parts on synthesizers, and "Fred the Robot"
                    voicing the "Prologue" and "Epilogue" &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Electric+Light+Orchestra/Time"&gt;Read

				<summary>Electric Light Orchestra were a symphonic rock band which formed in Birmingham, England in 1970.
                The band was formed by Jeff Lynne (vocals, guitar, multiple instruments), Roy Wood (multiple
                instruments, vocals), Richard Tandy (keyboards,
                vocals) and Bev Bevan (drums). Lynne, Wood and Bevan were former members of the psychedelic rock band
                The Move. The band's lineup would fluctuate throughout its original incarnation, although Lynne,
                Tandy and Bevan would remain constant members.

				<content>Electric Light Orchestra were a symphonic rock band which formed in Birmingham, England in 1970.
                The band was formed by Jeff Lynne (vocals, guitar, multiple instruments), Roy Wood (multiple
                instruments, vocals), Richard Tandy (keyboards,
                vocals) and Bev Bevan (drums). Lynne, Wood and Bevan were former members of the psychedelic rock band
                The Move. The band's lineup would fluctuate throughout its original incarnation, although Lynne,
                Tandy and Bevan would remain constant
                members.

They incorporated the sounds of string ensembles, vocoders and dub echos into rock
                songs, thereby creating a very sophisticated studio version of rock. The musical content of ELO songs
                often went far beyond usual chord structures,
                mixing pop songwriting with classical romanticism and synthesized sounds. The band claim that their
                music "picks up where The Beatles' 1967 song I Am the Walrus left off."

Formed
                in 1970 by Roy Wood, Jeff Lynne and Bev Bevan
                (the remaining members of the 1960s rock group The Move). The band used cellos, violin, horns and
                woodwinds to give their music a classical sound. This was an idea Roy Wood initially had while with The
                Move, to take rock music in a new direction. In
                1970 when Carl Wayne left the The Move, Jeff Lynne, front man with fellow Brum band Idle Race, responded
                to Wood's second invitation to join the line-up, with the lure of starting the new band. To help
                finance the fledgling project, two more
                Move albums were released during the recording of their eponymous first album in 1971 which produced the
                UK hit 10538 Overture. In the US this album was released with the mistaken title of No Answer, due to a
                mix-up with an uncompleted telephone call
                to the American label and subsequent secretarial message.

However, tensions soon surfaced
                between Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne. With most of the media attention focused on Roy Wood, differences in
                musical direction, and a disastrous first live
                outing, it was no surprise when the band went through the first of its many line-up changes as Wood took
                Hugh McDowell and Bill Hunt with him to form Wizzard. Despite the music press's predictions that
                the band would fold without Wood, Jeff
                Lynne stepped up to lead the band, with Bevan remaining on drums, bassist Richard Tandy switching to
                moog synthesizer, Michael d'Albuquerque on bass, Mike Edwards, Colin Walker (cello) and Wilfred
                Gibson replacing Steve Woolam on violin. They
                released ELO 2 in 1973, from which came their first U.S. chart hit, a hugely elaborate version of the
                Chuck Berry classic Roll Over Beethoven. After their second album, violinist Gibson was dismissed and
                replaced by Mik Kaminski. They also released
                On The Third Day in 1973, with Mike Edwards playing all the cello parts due to Colin Walker leaving the
                band. Later that same year saw the return of Hugh McDowell, who had jumped ship the year previous, to
                replace cellist Colin Walker.

In
                1974 Lynne hired a thirty-piece orchestra, choir and Louis Clark, then began work on the next LP
                Eldorado, A Symphony, a concept album about dreams, scoring their first U.S. Top Ten hit with Can't
                Get It Out Of My Head in 1975. Eldorado would
                become ELO's first gold album.
 
After the release of Eldorado, bassist and vocalist Kelly
                Groucutt and cellist Melvyn Gale joined, replacing de Albuquerque and Edwards respectively.

The
                band split in 1983. In 1985, Lynne, Tandy
                and Bevan reunited and recorded the album "Balance of Power". This reunion was short lived and
                the band split once more in 1986. Bev Bevan and Louis Clark, with the consent of Lynne, toured and
                recorded as ELO Part II from 1988 until
                Bevan's retirement in 1999. In 2000, Lynne and Tandy reformed Electric Light Orchestra and released
                a new record, "Zoom". "Zoom" proved to be a commercial failure, and the duo split
                once more in 2001. &lt;a

                label imprint Freebandz. Future subsequently began working on his debut studio album "Pluto,"
                and in April 2012 released the album to positive reviews. The album spawned five singles, all of which

                was later re-released in November, as "Pluto 3D." His second studio album "Honest,"
                was released on April 22, 2014, and is also performing with his group Freeband Gang. He released his
                highly anticipated third studio album,
                "DS2," on July 16, 2015. The Atlanta rapper also released several mixtape during 2015, "Beast

					<content>Badlands is the debut studio album by American singer and songwriter Halsey, released on August

                    Element. After writing the first few songs, Halsey came
                    to the realization that the entire concept was a metaphor for her mental state. Halsey states that
                    she created the Badlands as an escape from her real life struggles. In her opinion, the metaphor was
                    that even with no escape, there is still optimism
                    that there is somewhere else to go. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Halsey/BADLANDS"&gt;Read

					<content>At the beginning of their career, Incubus was rightly lumped in with the legions of post-Korn
                    alt metal/rap-rock bands swarming America in the latter days of the 20th century. But by their third
                    album, 1999's Make Yourself, they had
                    separated from the pack, as indicated by the presence of producer Scott Litt, best-known for his
                    work with R.E.M.. It signaled that the band was serious, and they began expanding their rap-metal
                    template on that album and its follow-up, 2001's
                    Morning View, completing their transition from juvenelia to maturity with 2003's Crow Left of
                    the Murder. Switching from Litt to producer Brendan O'Brien, a man who has been with Pearl Jam
                    longer than any of their drummers, Incubus has
                    opted for a clean, crisp yet heavy sound which allows them to aggressively switch from crunching
                    metallic riffs to jazzy prog interludes. It's an expansive musical vision charged with some
                    righteous anger; although vocalist Brandon Boyd
                    doesn't write explicit protests, there sure are enough allusions to social turbulence to make
                    this the first politically aware alt metal album in many a year. This maturation is even more
                    evident in the music, how the band actually swings on
                    "Zee Deveel," or how guitarist Michael Einzinger's jazz-influenced solos seem both
                    carefully constructed and casually tossed off, or how Boyd's voice shifts from song to song (or
                    during a song, as on the opening
                    "Megalomaniac," which sounds like a bizarre blend of Mr. Mister's Richard Page and
                    John Lydon). All this maturation does mean that Incubus may shed some older fans, since the naked
                    ambitions on this record are far removed from the
                    earnest, angst-ridden earlier records, but so be it -- A Crow Left of the Murder... is far more
                    interesting than any of their other records, or their peers'. At times, they may stretch
                    themselves a little too far here, but the ambition is
                    admirable and the achievements are tangible -- a real breakthrough for the band. [A Crow Left of the
                    Murder was also released in a limited-edition set with a bonus DVD containing a 26-minute
                    documentary featuring footage from the band's
                    Lollapalooza and Bridge Benefit performances, and of Boyd's injury.] ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine,

                    album.[10] However, until November 20th, 2016, [11][12] Light Grenades held the dubious honor of
                    having the title of the biggest drop from No. 1 in chart
                    history, falling from No. 1 to No. 37 in its second week on the Billboard 200 Albums chart. The
                    album only achieved Gold, breaking a string of Platinum records beginning with 2002's Morning
                    View.[13]

History

"Earth to
                    Bella" and "Love Hurts" made their live debut in front of an audience at the Make
                    Some Noise concert on April 29, 2006.

"A Kiss to Send Us Off" and "Anna
                    Molly" made their live debut on VH1's Decades
                    Rock: Live Tribute to the Pretenders on August 11, 2006, even though the songs were not featured in
                    the program. The same two songs were also performed at Edgefest 2006 on September 30 at Tempe Beach
                    Park, Arizona.

"Rogues" made
                    its debut at a pair of pre album-release shows at the London Astoria and the Berlin Postbahnhof on
                    November 14 and 16 2006.

The songs "Punch Drunk" and "Look Alive" were
                    recorded during the Light Grenades sessions, but
                    were originally only available as bonus tracks on the Japanese edition of the album. Live versions
                    have since seen release worldwide on the Look Alive live DVD. The studio versions of both songs are
                    also on Monuments and Melodies.

Musical
                    style

Mike Einziger, Incubus' guitarist, commented in an interview with MTV that the
                    album "sounds like 13 different bands playing 13 different songs... Every time we're about
                    to start making a new album, I tell myself,
                    'Okay, this one's going to be cohesive,' and it never happens."[14] For the most
                    part, Light Grenades expands upon the sounds previously explored in 2004's A Crow Left of the
                    Murder....

Other songs showcase a new
                    direction for the band. For example, Brandon Boyd describes the curious recording technique behind
                    "Paper Shoes": "There's a song called 'Paper Shoes' where Michael and
                    I mic'd our bodies with ambient mics and did
                    the percussion tracks pounding on our chests and skulls. The galloping rhythm is us pounding on our
                    chests. It was really funny. We were trying so hard not to laugh because we were sitting there like
                    cavemen beating our
                    chests!"
Themes
When asked about the album title, frontman Brandon Boyd explained:
                    "There's a song called that on the record and it felt like the most pertinent conceptual
                    aspect of the album, the idea of throwing ideas at
                    problems and the ideas explode with light and good results and intention on consciousness. So I
                    started imagining imagery of students in different countries protesting and throwing Molotov
                    cocktails with masks over their faces. But there's one
                    brave student who runs up to the police line and, as opposed to throwing rocks or things that
                    destroy, there's this concept of that one courageous, lonely student running up and throwing
                    ideas and having them actually change things. It just
                    seemed kind of a cool concept: the redefining of weaponry."

					<summary>Make Yourself is the third album by American rock band Incubus, released through Immortal
                    Records on October 26, 1999. The album has been certified double platinum in the United States along
                    with featuring three charting singles,
                    "Pardon Me", "Stellar", and "Drive", all of which reached the top
                    three of the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

This album saw the beginning of the band's
                    stylistic shift from the metal &amp; funk of
                    previous albums into a more melodic, groove-oriented alternative rock approach. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Incubus/Make+Yourself"&gt;Read

                    the lack of slap bass and guitar palm muting, which can only slightly be found in "Out From
                    Under". The drums are also quieter as just a
                    single pedal is used, this is again heard on later releases. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Incubus/Make+Yourself"&gt;Read

					<summary>Morning View is the fourth studio album by alternative rock band Incubus, released October 23,
                    2001. This is the band's last album to feature bassist Alex Katunich.

The album has a
                    sound that is overall softer than previous
                    albums, especially apparent on songs such as "Echo" and "Are You In?", however,
                    Incubus's heavier side is still evident on tracks like "Have You Ever" and "Under
                    My Umbrella". Songs such as "Just a
                    Phase" display more original song structures. Regarding the album's sound, guitarist Mike

 "would've been really easy for us to try to replicate
                    certain songs that did well on our last record,
                    which we didn't do. We didn't do anything even remotely close to that. We put pressure on
                    ourselves to make a good record because if none of us were happy with it, we'll all be
                    miserable for the next two years while we're on
                    tour."

Five years after the album's release, an official video for the song

                Katunich (a.k.a. Dirk Lance) (bass). The band's name may seem a peculiar choice to fans, as an
                incubus is a type of demon that, in mythological
                lore, comes in the night and has sex with women while they are sleeping; it seduces them in their dreams
                The story behind the name is that the band needed to think of a name hours before their first show and,
                after a few failed choices, Mike looked
                in a dictionary and chose "Incubus" almost at random. Mike says that the name was chosen
                because it sounded silly; Brandon holds that it was chosen because they were teenagers and the
                definition had the word "sex" in it. "We
                really didn't want to rape women in their sleep. But, we were fifteen and it seemed harmless to us
                then, and we never changed it," says the band.

Incubus has received both critical acclaim
                and commercial success, reaching
                multi-platinum sales, as well as releasing several successful singles. The band earned mainstream
                recognition with the release of their 1999 album Make Yourself. In 2001, Incubus became even more
                successful with the single "Drive" and their
                follow-up album Morning View. Their sixth studio album, Light Grenades, debuted at No. 1 in 2006 and has
                received Gold certification in the U.S. Incubus released their first greatest hits album Monuments and
                Melodies in June 2009, accompanied by a
                tour of the United States, Japan and Canada. The band's most recent album, If Not Now, When?, was
                released on July 12, 2011.

Incubus is also a death/thrash metal band with christian lyrics.
                they changed names to Opprobrium in 1999 &lt;a

					<summary>Fear of the Dark is the ninth studio album released by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It
                    topped the UK albums chart. Released on 11 May 1992, it was the final studio album to feature Bruce
                    Dickinson as lead vocalist who left the band
                    following the album's support tour to pursue a solo career. He was succeeded by Blaze Bayley,
                    formerly of Wolfsbane, for two studio albums until Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden for the 2000
                    release of Brave New World. &lt;a

					<content>Fear of the Dark is the ninth studio album released by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It
                    topped the UK albums chart. Released on 11 May 1992, it was the final studio album to feature Bruce
                    Dickinson as lead vocalist who left the band
                    following the album's support tour to pursue a solo career. He was succeeded by Blaze Bayley,
                    formerly of Wolfsbane, for two studio albums until Dickinson returned to Iron Maiden for the 2000
                    release of Brave New World.

History:
The
                    album cover of Fear of the Dark was the first Iron Maiden album cover not to be designed by artist
                    Derek Riggs. In an interview with MTV, Bruce Dickinson said they had asked three different artists
                    to design a cover, and they then picked the best
                    one. Melvyn Grant's illustration was chosen over the one Riggs submitted. Melvyn Grant has
                    since drawn two more album covers for Iron Maiden, and the cover for their single "The
                    Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg" makes him the second
                    most-used artist for Eddie after Riggs.

The album's musical style showed some
                    experimentation with "Be Quick or Be Dead", a speed metal song released as the album's
                    first single, and "Wasting Love", the
                    group's sole power ballad. The Gulf War track "Afraid to Shoot Strangers" was the
                    band's most political song since "2 Minutes to Midnight". The album featured first
                    time songwriting credits for Janick Gers and featured
                    more keyboard work than the previous album.

Only two songs off of the album, the title
                    track, and "Afraid to Shoot Strangers", would survive on tours past 1993. "Fear of
                    the Dark" became a popular live track and was the
                    only song played on the Somewhere Back in Time World Tour not from the 1980s. "Afraid to Shoot
                    Strangers" became a frequent addition on setlists during Blaze Bayley's tenure with Iron
                    Maiden.

Both critics and fans saw the
                    album as a stale offering from an increasingly tired band. Dickinson's committment to the band
                    was in question and the inclusion of a ballad left veteran fans disillusioned. Much mocked was
                    Harris' 'Weekend Warrior,' which was
                    viewed as an outdated view on 80's football hooliganism. The line "what you gonna do on
                    Monday?" came in for much abuse. Metal Hammer criticised the lyrics on such tracks as 'The
                    Apparition' and 'The Fugitive', but
                    said the guitar solos redeemed the otherwise mediocre songs.

"Be Quick or Be Dead,"
                    "From Here to Eternity," "Wasting Love," and a live version of the title track
                    were released as singles.

Fear Of The
                    Dark Tour was the tour supporting the album. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden/Fear+of+the+Dark"&gt;Read

					<content>Iron Maiden, released on April 14, 1980, is the debut album by the British rock band Iron
                    Maiden. It was released by EMI in the UK, reaching number 4 in the UK album charts. The album was
                    released a few months later in the U.S. originally on
                    Harvest/Capitol Records and subsequently Sanctuary Records/Columbia Records and included the song
                    "Sanctuary", which had been released in the UK only as a single, added to the track
                    listing. In 1998, just like all other pre-X Factor albums,
                    the album was re-released, and "Sanctuary" was added in all territories.
Of all the
                    songs in this album, "Phantom of the Opera," "Running Free," "Sanctuary"
                    and "Iron Maiden" remain on the set
                    lists of nearly all of the band's concert tours, with the latter used to introduce a giant
                    representation of the band's mascot Eddie from the back of the stage.
Four songs from the
                    album: "Prowler", "Remember
                    Tomorrow", "Running Free" and "Iron Maiden" were covered for the 2008
                    tribute album Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden released by Kerrang! magazine.
Every song
                    on this album except 'Strange World' has
                    since been recorded by the Dickinson-fronted line-up of the band, either on live albums, on studio
                    B-Sides, or both.

This was the only album produced by Will Malone, who lacked interest in
                    the project and allowed the band to produce most of
                    the album themselves. The band (especially Steve Harris) criticised the quality of the production,
                    but many fans like the raw, almost punk-like sound to the songs. This was also the only studio album
                    for guitarist Dennis Stratton, who left a short
                    time after the album was released. He was replaced by Adrian Smith. "Transylvania" is a
                    well known instrumental piece by the band which was composed by founder and bassist Steve Harris.
                    The song was covered by Iced Earth on the album Horror
                    Show. "Strange World" tells of a dystopian society, where people never grow old. Amongst
                    other things the narrator (singer) laments how "smiling faces [are] ever so rare".
                    Meanwhile, "Charlotte the Harlot" is the first
                    of four Iron Maiden songs which make reference to the fictional prostitute 'Charlotte'.
                    The 7-minute epic "Phantom of the Opera" remains a fan favourite, and is still performed
                    at many Maiden concerts, while live performances of
                    "Iron Maiden" often signal the entrance of band mascot Eddie onto the stage.
"Running
                    Free" was released as a single on February 23rd, 1980, and reached number 34 in the UK singles
                    chart. The band also performed the song
                    entirely live on the UK TV show Top Of The Pops. The usual tradition was for artists to lip-synch,
                    and Maiden were the first band to perform their song without lip-synching on the show since The Who
                    in 1972.
The "Sanctuary" single was
                    released on June 7th, and charted at number 29. Manager Rod Smallwood's management company was
                    named after the song.
The 1998 re-release has, besides the addition of the previously mentioned
                    song "Sanctuary", a different cover than
                    the original release. The picture is the same, except that it's redrawn. However, on recent
                    advertising-posters and the Iron Maiden website, the original cover is once again shown.
Metal
                    For Muthas Tour and Europe 80 was the tour supporting
                    the album Iron Maiden.

					<summary>Piece of Mind is the fourth studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was
                    originally released in 1983 (see 1983 in music) on EMI, and on Capitol in the US; it was reissued
                    later on Sanctuary/Columbia Records. It was the first
                    album to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who had recently left the Paris-based band Trust.

"The
                    Trooper" remains as one of the most popular songs in the band's history, and has been

					<content>Piece of Mind is the fourth studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. It was
                    originally released in 1983 (see 1983 in music) on EMI, and on Capitol in the US; it was reissued
                    later on Sanctuary/Columbia Records. It was the first
                    album to feature drummer Nicko McBrain, who had recently left the Paris-based band Trust.

"The
                    Trooper" remains as one of the most popular songs in the band's history, and has been
                    included in the set list of all of the
                    band's concert tours since the album's release. During the Blaze Bayley era, it was used
                    as the closing song for the lineup's tours.

Two songs were covered for the 2008
                    tribute album Maiden Heaven: A Tribute to Iron Maiden;
                    they were "The Trooper" and "To Tame a Land".

 
History
Lyrically,
                    the album reflected the group's interest in books and film. For example, "To Tame a Land"
                    is based on Frank Herbert's novel
                    Dune. "The Trooper" is inspired by Tennyson's Charge of the Light Brigade. "Still
                    Life" is inspired by fantasy/horror writer Clark Ashton Smith's pre-World War II short
                    story Genius Loci. Other inspirations include
                    "Where Eagles Dare", a film, and a novel by Alistair MacLean; "Quest for Fire",
                    based on the film by Jean-Jacques Annaud; the writer G. K. Chesterton who is quoted at the beginning
                    of "Revelations". More exotic
                    influences include Greek mythology, albeit slightly altered for "Flight of Icarus", and
                    samurai legend Miyamoto Musashi ("Sun and Steel"). Aleister Crowley influenced a good
                    piece of the remaining lyrics of
                    "Revelations," which was written by Dickinson.

This is the first Iron Maiden
                    album that was not named after a song featured on the album itself (though the words "peace of
                    mind" appear prominently in the album's
                    sixth song, "Still Life"). In its earliest phase the album was named Food for Thought but
                    was changed so it would suit the artwork more. The name of the last track was meant to be "Dune,"
                    but Frank Herbert, who disliked heavy rock
                    bands, denied permission to use his book's name and thus a new name had to be chosen.

Included
                    in the liner notes is a slightly altered version of a passage from the Book of Revelation. As
                    printed in the liner notes, it
                    reads:

"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more
                    Death. Neither sorrow, nor crying. Neither shall there be any more brain; for the former things are
                    passed away."

The actual text (from
                    Chapter 21, Verse 4) is nearly identical, except that it says "neither shall there be any more
                    pain..." . This change can be seen either as a reference to the album's name, or the
                    removal of Eddie's brain on the cover, or to
                    drummer Nicko McBrain's inception into the band for this album.

World Piece Tour was
                    the tour supporting the album.

The album ranked 21 on IGN's list of the top 25 metal
                    albums.


 Hidden message
At the
                    beginning of the sixth track, Still Life, the band included a hidden message which could only be
                    understood by playing the album backwards. This was a joke and an intended swing back at the critics
                    who had accused Maiden of being satanic. The
                    backwards-message features Nicko McBrain mimicking Idi Amin (or rather mimicking John Bird mimicking
                    Idi Amin) uttering the following phrase "What ho said the t'ing with the three "bonce",
                    do not meddle with things you don't
                    understand...", followed by a belch. The phrase itself is taken from the satirical album The
                    Colleckerted [sic] Broadcasts of Idi Amin by Bird and Alan Coren. "What ho" and "What
                    ho said the t'ing" are phrases that also
                    crop up regularly on McBrain's "Listen With Nicko!" tracks from the First Ten Years
                    collection.

                    13 minutes and 38 seconds. The album is also notable amongst the band's albums as being the
                    first album to feature the same lineup as the previous
                    one.

"2 Minutes to Midnight" and "Aces High" were released as singles,
                    the former being a staple in nearly all of the band's concert tours.

World Slavery
                    Tour was the tour supporting the album. &lt;a

					<content>The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The
                    album was released on March 29, 1982 through EMI. This was the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson in
                    Iron Maiden. Number of the Beast has been

                    one of the best and most iconic albums of the genre.

The Number of the Beast also cemented
                    Iron Maiden as one of "the biggest metal bands
                    on the planet".

Of all the songs in the album, "The Number of the Beast",
                    "Run to the Hills" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name" remain on the set lists of nearly
                    all of the band's concert tours, with the
                    latter two often used to close a show. All three songs have been released as singles in various
                    forms.

The Beast on the Road was the tour supporting the album.


 History
The
                    Number of the Beast marked Bruce Dickinson's
                    debut with the band. Though the recording process was successful, it was plagued with bizarre events
                    - during the making of the album, record producer Martin Birch had been in an accident and crashed
                    his car into one driven by a "religious
                    nutter" on a rainy Sunday evening. When he got his car back from the mechanic the bill came
                    back in the exact amount of £666.66. Birch, "terrified", demanded the bill be rounded up
                    to £667. Also, the title track reached number 18 in
                    the UK charts - the sum of three sixes. Other stories about various strange occurrences at the
                    recording studio have circulated, such as equipment randomly breaking down and lights turning off
                    and on by themselves.

Since this album (and its
                    tour, Beast on the Road), "The Beast" has become something of a nickname for the band and
                    possibly Eddie, as suggested by albums such as Best of the Beast (which featured a 'best of
                    Eddie' mural on the cover), Beast over
                    Hammersmith, and the DVD Visions of the Beast.

This album is the only one to feature
                    songwriting by drummer Clive Burr. This is one of several reasons why the album was so different
                    from previous ones other than the obvious change in lead
                    singer. It was the first album with writing by Adrian Smith (see below track listing for details),
                    and the first to feature writing by the 'new' Steve Harris (his older style had been
                    written for different musicians, and in a different
                    time) - the entire writing system was different. However, it is one of the few albums not to feature
                    a Dave Murray song, and the first album not to feature an instrumental.


Reception
It
                    was widely panned by mainstream media upon its
                    release, including Rolling Stone, who claimed that it "blusters along aimlessly, proving again
                    that bad music is hell."

It was also panned by social conservatives, especially in
                    America. Due to its title, Iron Maiden was called a
                    "Satanic band" in the US. Their Beast on the Road tour was marred by boycotts and
                    protests.

However, as time passed by, The Number of the Beast became one of the most
                    critically acclaimed metal albums of all time, and was more
                    accepted after the band became more mainstream.

Allmusic said: "The Number of the
                    Beast is quite simply one of the best heavy metal albums ever released."

The album was
                    ranked number 17 on Guitar World's list of the
                    100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 100 in its
                    list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, and a year later the same magazine named it as one of
                    the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The BBC made a
                    documentary of this album in their Classic Albums series.

IGN named it the third greatest
                    heavy metal album of all time.

Metal-Rules.com named this the second greatest heavy metal
                    album of all time.

The album is also a part
                    of EMI's "Albums That Shaped Rock History" series.


Album artwork
The
                    album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title
                    track and the cover art depicting Satan being
                    controlled by Eddie. This cover art was originally intended for an earlier single, "Purgatory",
                    but the band felt the cover was too high of caliber for just a single and a less complex image was
                    used for the single instead. The title track,
                    "Number of the Beast", was said not be a satanic song was actually instead inspired by
                    bass player Steve Harris's nightmares about dabbling in Satanism. The album's cover art
                    has been parodied several times - by crossover thrash
                    band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger Than the Devil, and on a
                    T-shirt by underground New York Hip Hop Label Uncle Howie Records *Streetwear brand Diamond Supply
                    Co. parodied the album cover for a shirt in their
                    line. Nick Tershay, founder of Diamond is reported as having had to pay $50,000 due to the parody
                    being too close to the original art work.

The original 1982 artwork includes a light blue
                    sky in the background; this was a mistake by the
                    printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered
                    for compact disc in 1998.


 Lyrical themes
While the title track was thought by
                    many to be an assumption Iron Maiden were Satanists,
                    in fact the song was inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the
                    film Damien: Omen II late at night. While he was quite scared of the Satanic images he saw in his
                    nightmare, he also felt them amusing, and after that,
                    he obtained the idea for the song, and also for the title of the album.


"Children
                    of the Damned" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in
                    turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich
                    Cuckoos by John Wyndham. On a recent "Bruce Dickinson Rock Show" on BBC Radio 6, Dickinson
                    told Ronnie James Dio that Children of the Damned was inspired by "Children of the Sea".

"The
                    Prisoner" was inspired by
                    the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. Rod Smallwood
                    had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the dialogue for the song. According to
                    witnesses the usually calm Smallwood was completely
                    star struck during the conversation. McGoohan was reported to have said "What did you say the
                    name was? Iron Maiden? Do it." Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, "Back
                    in the Village" from
                    Powerslave.

"22 Acacia Avenue" is the second song in the "Charlotte the
                    Harlot" saga.

The title track opens with a spoken introduction which draws heavily
                    from the King James Version of Revelation 13:18, and is
                    apparently inspired by Tam o' Shanter by Robert Burns. Barry Clayton is the name of the actor
                    who speaks those opening lines on the album.


Classic Albums
 
The cover for
                    DVD, Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast.The
                    making of the album was released as a video on December 4, 2001 through Eagle Visions, as part of
                    the documentary series, Classic Albums.


The video was directed by Tim Kirkby and
                    featured cuts from the title track, "Children of the
                    Damned", "Run to the Hills", and "The Prisoner". In addition, extended
                    interviews and live footage of "Hallowed Be Thy Name" —recorded during the band's
                    performance at the Rock in Rio festval in 2001— were
                    included.

The video reached number 9 on the Norwegian DVD Charts,[6] and was certifed Gold
                    by the Australian Recording Industry Association.

It was released in DVD, VHS and UMD
                    formats, and featured subtitles in six different
                    languages, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.

 Appearance in media
On
                    October 24, 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety
                    at La Mutualite in Paris, France. The
                    performance was recorded and has been released through the band's YtseJam Records label.

"Run
                    To The Hills" was covered on the all-star tribute album Numbers From The Beast, featuring
                    vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael
                    Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin, and drummer Brian Tichy. The version slightly
                    varied from the original, in terms of guitars, when Schenker added small solos.

"Hallowed
                    Be Thy Name" was covered by Machine Head on
                    the Maiden Heaven: A Tribute To Iron Maiden tribute album released by Kerrang! magazine in 2008.

The
                    album has also been used in several video games - "Run To The Hills" is featured on SSX On
                    Tour as the opening theme, and a cover
                    version is a track in Rock Band in which it is the only song on the disk listed as an 'Impossible'
                    song for all the instruments. "The Number Of The Beast" is included as a master track in

 Chart performance
The Number of the
                    Beast was released on March 29, 1982, and quickly
                    became a commercial success around the world.[8] It was the band's first effort to top the UK
                    charts, and enter the Billboard 200—at number 150. The album reached the top 10 in Austria and
                    Sweden, and hit number 11 and 13 in Canada and Norway
                    respectively. It was awarded platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and received a
                    gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 4, 1983.
                    Although the album failed to chart in Germany, it was
                    certified gold ten years later, and received a 3× platinum award in Canada for sells exceeding
                    300,000 units. Two songs were released as singles, "Run to the Hills" and the title track,
                    which debuted in the United Kingdom at number 7—their
                    highest chart position at the time— and number 18 respectively. Both songs entered the singles chart
                    in Ireland in the same order —at number 16 and 19.

1) Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band
                formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band's
                discography has grown to thirty-seven
                albums, including fifteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations.

Pioneers
                of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s.
                After several line-up changes, the
                band went on to release a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums, including 1982's The Number
                of the Beast, 1983's Piece of Mind, 1984's Powerslave, 1985's live release Live After
                Death , 1986's Somewhere in Time and
                1988's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and
                guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their latest
                studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No.
                1 in 28 different countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim.

Despite little radio or
                television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history,
                with The New York Times reporting in 2010
                that they have sold over 85 million records worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for
                international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows
                throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band
                have been supported by their famous mascot, "Eddie", who has appeared on almost all of their
                album and single covers, as well as in their live shows.

The band has changed their line-up
                several times up to 1999 when Bruce Dickinson
                and Adrian Smith returned to the band. 

Their current line-up is:

Steve Harris
                (1975-): bass, backing vocals, studio keyboards
David Michael Murray (1975-): guitar
Paul Bruce
                Dickinson (1981-1993 1999-): lead vocals (see
                also Bruce Dickinson, Samson)
Nicko McBrain (1983-): drums, percussion (see also Trust)
Janick
                Gers (1990-): guitar (see also Bruce Dickinson, White Spirit)
Adrian Smith (1980-1990, 1999-):
                guitar, backing vocals (see also Bruce Dickinson
                and Psycho Motel).

Former members:

Doug Sampson – drums, percussion (1977–1979)
Dennis
                Stratton – guitars, backing vocals (1979–1980)
Paul Di'Anno – lead vocals (1978–1981)
Clive
                Burr – drums, percussion
                (1979–1982)
Blaze Bayley – lead vocals (1994–1998)
Dennis Wilcock - lead vocals (1976–1977)
Barry
                Purkis – drums, percussion (1977)
Paul Day - lead vocals (1975–1976).

Iron Maiden's
                work has inspired other sub-genres of
                heavy metal, including power metal and speed metal, and is generally thought of as an influence to any
                "metal" music containing dual-guitar harmonization. One example of their far reaching
                influence is that many bands from virtually every
                rock and metal sub-genre list Iron Maiden as one of their influences.

Many of the band's
                songs are based on history, folklore, movies and books, such as Aces High, Brave New World, The Trooper,
                The Clansman, The Wicker Man, The
                Prisoner, Where Eagles Dare, Out of the Silent Planet, To Tame a Land(based on Frank Herbert's
                Dune) and Rime of the Ancient Mariner – in which words from the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem are
                incorporated into the song.

2) Iron Maiden (later aka The Bolton Iron Maiden) is
                a late sixties doom-band. This Iron Maiden was formed in 1964 by Barry Skeels, Steve Drewett, Chris Rose
                and Alan Hooker as an acoustic band in
                Basildon, Essex that eventually evolved into a band called Iron Maiden. By 1966, the lineup was Skeels
                (bass), Drewett (vocals/harmonies), Rose (lead guitar), Tom Loates (rhythm guitar) and Stan Gillem
                (drums); they played Rolling Stones and blues
                numbers under the name "Growth". Reduced to a two-piece, Drewett and Skeels played blues under
                the name of "Stevenson's Blues Department" in pubs and clubs in Essex and London. They
                supported a number of up and coming bands
                including Jethro Tull, Fleetwood Mac, The Groundhogs and King Crimson.

In 1968, Drewett and
                Skeels were joined by Paul Reynolds (drums) and Trevor Thoms (guitar). They released an acetate (God of
                Darkness/Ballad of Martha Kent) under the
                then risqué name of BUM. When they signed to the Gemini label in 1970, the name was changed to the less
                risqué Iron Maiden. They recorded their debut album Maiden Voyage. Reynolds was replaced by Steve
                Chapman on drums and Iron Maiden released the
                single Ned Kelly/Falling. This coincided with Mick Jagger's film "Ned Kelly". A planned
                Australian tour fell through. The Gemini record label also folded (with the loss of the debut album
                master tapes) and Skeels left Iron Maiden. The
                band carried on without him for a while, but the debut album was not released until 1998 using duplicate
                tapes owned by Skeels. This "original" Iron Maiden is often considered by fans as one of the
                earliest 'true' doom metal
                bands.

However, soon after the "original" Iron Maiden was re-discovered , their name
                was officially changed to 'The Bolton Iron Maiden' since the Iron Maiden led by Steve Harris
                already had the name 'Iron
                Maiden' trademarked. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Iron+Maiden"&gt;Read more on

                Lights. Songfacts reports that he dropped his
                first official single, Work Out on June 15, 2011, the two-year anniversary of The Warm Up. He released
                his highly anticipated debut album "Cole World: The Sideline Story" on Tuesday, September 27,
                2011. It debuted at number 1 on the
                Billboard 200 with approximately 218,000 units sold.

Cole has appeared on the cover of The
                Source and Beyond Race magazines, as well as being featured as one of XXL’s 2010 Freshmen. Cole appeared
                on Jay-Z’s 2009 album The Blueprint 3, on the
                track A Star is Born, and is also featured on labelmate Wale’s debut album, Attention Deficit. Most
                recently, he was touring with Jay-Z, Young Jeezy, and Trey Songz on The Blueprint 3 tour. In January
                2010, along with Jay Electronica and Mos Def, he
                appeared on the first single from the new Reflection Eternal album, Just Begun.

The rap world
                is at a crossroads. In the face of shrinking budgets, music executives, resting on their laurels, search
                out the next YouTube sensation with a
                catchy hook and dance move in order to amass digital single sales. While many artists have tried to
                break through despite an industry melt down, few have been met with critical praise. And the applause
                for those that have has not been loud enough to
                sway the course of the current rap market. Looking to excel where his contemporaries have failed, North
                Carolina native J. Cole (born Jermaine Cole) brings promise of a new day in hip hop music.Raised by his
                mother in North Carolina, J. Cole's
                hometown of Fayetteville would provide much of the sights and experiences that would come to shape his
                sound. Cole fell into rapping at the age of 12 when his cousin from Louisiana spent the summer in
                Fayetteville, showing him the basics of rhyming.
                He was instantly hooked. From there he delved deep into the music of hip hop luminaries including Tupac
                Shakur, Nas and Outkast, taking from them a love for telling stories with an unbridled rigor. Seizing
                every opportunity to write, at age 15 J.
                Cole found himself with composition notebooks full of rhymes but no beats of his own to lay them on.
                Determined to create original songs, he begged his mother for a beat machine so he could produce music
                solely for himself. She granted his wish and
                from there, a young Cole spent all his free time creating sounds and songs that would lay the foundation
                for what his style has evolved to today.

Feeling the need to be heard, J. Cole used college as
                a tool to chase his dreams. He attended
                St. John's University on an academic scholarship, choosing the school so that he could be in the
                heart of the music industry: New York City. After polishing his sound and graduating Magna Cum Laude, J.
                Cole is dropping his debut mixtape,
                properly titled "The Come Up" hosted by DJ On Point. A mash up of dusty, soul filled sound
                beds, raw, energetic drums and an endless range of topics everything from the carefree days of college
                to the seemingly endless plight of those
                have-nots scrapping for change. The Come Up puts J. Cole's broad palette of lyrical and production
                talents on display. "All a nigga wanna do is take his momma from that, but they rather lock us up
                and make sure we don't come
                back," he vehemently spits over the cascading keys and triumphant strings of the self produced
                "Lil' Ghetto Nigga."

With such a diverse display, J. Cole is poised to wake up a
                dormant industry and cement his name in this
                game. But more than that, with his debut studio album currently in production, he hopes to change the
                tide of current rap music, swaying it in a more insightful, meaningful and passionate direction."

                    musical elements of blues and soul more heavily than in his previous work with pop-rock.[3][5][6]

The
                    album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling 300,186 copies in its first week.
                    It also reached the top-ten in several
                    other countries and sold over 3 million copies worldwide. Upon its release, Continuum received
                    generally positive reviews from most music critics and earned Mayer several accolades, including a
                    Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 49th Grammy
                    Awards. Rolling Stone magazine named it the eleventh best album of 2006.

Background

Mayer
                    made the decision to name his third album Continuum at least a year before the album was released.
                    In his column in the April 2005 issue of
                    Esquire, Mayer wrote, "I'm obsessed with time lately, constantly crunching the numbers to
                    get some sense of where I stand in the continuum."[8] In his column in the September 2005 issue
                    of Esquire he confirmed the title, writing,
                    "I've never experienced anything like the recording process involved in making Continuum,
                    my third-album-to-be.[9]

The album features mainly new songs, though "Gravity"
                    and "Vultures" are available in live
                    versions from John Mayer Trio's Try!, and "Bold as Love", which is a Jimi Hendrix
                    cover: the first Hendrix cover that Mayer has ever recorded as a studio release (although Mayer has
                    recorded other Hendrix songs over time in live
                    settings such as "The Wind Cries Mary" and "Wait Until Tomorrow"). (Mayer had
                    played "Bold as Love" live many times prior to the release of Continuum such as on the
                    televised Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope which aired on
                    January 15, 2005.) The album contains a collaboration between Mayer and 8-string guitarist Charlie
                    Hunter on the tune "In Repair". The song "Stop this Train" was written during a
                    time of, what Mayer calls, "solitary
                    refinement;" He was in bed suffering from double kidney stones, and living in a hotel while
                    finding a new residence.[10]

Cover art

The word "Continuum" is showcased
                    across the center. The typography for the title was
                    customized to give the letters "C" and "o" the appearance of an infinity symbol:
                    ∞. Many of the following letters touch in some way; the right vertical line of the second "u"
                    is the left vertical line of the
                    "m" in the title.

The album has been released several times with slight
                    differences in the artwork. The three major releases feature, respectively: A photo of Mayer; a
                    silver cover with a white title; and a Local 83-only version
                    (including a silver bag). The first features a dark gray-scale photograph of Mayer with the title
                    near the top; another is identical except for "featured" centered across the top. Some
                    versions feature only a CD. In these cases, the album
                    features Mayer on the cover. When the album is packaged with a jewel casing, the inside cover is all
                    white with the "Continuum" logo printed very faintly on it. The basic CD is white with
                    off-white letters that slides into a slipcase of
                    deep gray with lettering in light gray and blue/green. During the pre-order, it appeared as though
                    there would be a variation of said artwork on a special edition version, and it turned out that the
                    "special packaging" was a shiny silver
                    bag which held the CD and the pre-order bonuses. All artwork was designed by Mayer along with Smog
                    Design, Inc. The inside of the CD sleeve includes photographs, some taken by Mayer, such as of the
                    studio (where Mayer's handwriting describes,
                    "*this is what my heart looks like*") and a Ferris wheel where Mayer's handwriting is
                    imposed over the top of the photograph, featuring the lyrics to his songs. There is also a
                    photograph of Mayer with Pino Palladino and Steve Jordan
                    (the three who comprise the John Mayer Trio) on a beach. The CD sleeve features the lyrics to all of
                    Continuum's songs. With both Heavier Things and Room for Squares, there were incongruities with
                    the lyrics in the sleeves when compared with the
                    albums; however, the Continuum lyrics are all printed exactly as recorded on the album.

The
                    UK version of Continuum features a photograph of Mayer on the cover. This cover was used for
                    promotional releases, such as when Mayer performed live
                    on the Australian television program Rove Live. The alternative cover was presented for television
                    by the show's host Rove McManus.

In November 2007, a special edition of Continuum was
                    released. The cover for the special edition
                    features a grey background and silver text for the title, with the Columbia Records logo in black
                    instead of white. However, the line "Music by John Mayer" remains the same teal color as
                    on the regular release. The cover layout is the
                    same.

Release and Promotion

By the time of release, Mayer had performed almost all
                    of the songs live at least once, either with a full band or alone in an acoustic set during the
                    Hotel Cafe shows from the previous winter. On August
                    23, 2006, the entire Continuum album was played on Los Angeles radio station STAR 98.7, with the
                    segment hosted by Mayer himself.[11] He repeated the event for different media outlets several more
                    times before the album's September release, such
                    as "Sneak Peek" through Clear Channel Music; he also performed three songs live for
                    Sessions@AOL.[12] Subsequently, the album was made available for streaming on Clear Channel Music
                    website and for pre-purchase on iTunes, all prior to the
                    album's official release. The iTunes pre-release included the exclusive bonus track, "Can't
                    Take That Plane".

A limited edition EP of "Waiting on the World to Change"
                    was released featuring the album version of
                    the song. The EP includes a bonus acoustic version which features Ben Harper, as well as a studio
                    recording of "Good Love is on the Way", a live version of which was released on the John
                    Mayer Trio's Try!. The Ben Harper version of
                    "Waiting on the World to Change" and an alternative acoustic-only version of "Good
                    Love is on the Way" are also available on Mayer's subsequent release, the EP The Village
                    Sessions.

The first single, "Waiting on
                    the World to Change," was released on July 11, 2006. The music video for the song was directed
                    by Philip Andelman and features Mayer walking along the East River while graffiti artists Futura,
                    Tats Cru, and Daze graffiti messages on New York
                    City billboards displaying messages relating to the song's content. On February 22, 2007,
                    Continuum's second single, "Gravity", entered the Billboard Hot 100 at #71, joining
                    the already charting "Waiting on the World to
                    Change", making for two Continuum singles on the Hot 100 at the same time. It was featured in
                    the soundtrack for the television series House in 2008. "Waiting" entered the Billboard's
                    Hot 100 Digital Songs Chart at #63. It has
                    sold 68,115 in digital downloads since its release. Mayer performed the single "Gravity"
                    at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards with fellow musicians Corinne Bailey Rae and John Legend. "Dreaming
                    with a Broken Heart" is the third
                    official single release from Continuum, and was released for ads at Hot AC and Triple A radio on
                    July 9, 2007.

On November 20, 2007, a special edition of Continuum was released that
                    included a bonus disc of six live tracks and a 20-page
                    booklet containing photos from the tour. Five of the songs are live versions of tracks from
                    Continuum, including all of its singles. A sixth song, "I Don't Need No Doctor", was
                    originally performed by Ray Charles; Mayer previously
                    performed the song as part of his set with the John Mayer Trio. The single "Say" (from The
                    Bucket List soundtrack) was also made available on the CD through an online download unlock
                    function.[13] The tracks were produced by Mayer's
                    engineer Chad Franscoviak.

The album was reissued on Columbia Records on April 8, 2008,
                    with the single "Say" being added directly on the disc.[14] A vinyl lp version of this
                    reissue was also released, on two 180-gram
                    discs.

Commercial Performance

Continuum debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at
                    #2 with 300,186 copies sold.[15] It never reached #1, impeded by the Justin Timberlake album
                    FutureSex/LoveSounds, which was released at the same
                    time. As on November 2009, Continuum has sold 2,800,000 copies[16]in the U.S. and is Mayer's
                    third consecutive multi-platinum selling studio album. It stayed in the top 100 of Billboard's
                    Hot 100 chart for 50 weeks (37 of those weeks were
                    in the top 50).

Worldwide, it has moved more than 3 million copies.[citation needed] In
                    Canada, the album debuted at #2 on the official Albums Chart and is certified platinum for sales of
                    100,000 copies. According to Nielsen SoundScan,
                    Continuum was the fourth best selling digital album for 2006 in Canada. With no lead single in
                    Australia, Continuum debuted on the ARIA Albums Chart at #12,[17] his lowest debut in Australia to
                    date (Room for Squares debuted at #5 and Heavier Things
                    at #4). Continuum was the ninety-eighth best selling album for 2006 on the ARIA (ARIA) Albums Chart.
                    It has been certified gold by ARIA for sales of 35,000 copies and had stayed on ARIA's Top 100
                    Albums chart for 34 weeks before exiting the
                    chart. Continuum held the record for the most album downloads in history with over 326,000 copies
                    downloaded until June 29, 2008, when it was surpassed by the Coldplay album Viva la Vida or Death
                    and All His Friends.

On February 22, 2007,
                    the lead single, "Waiting on the World to Change", peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100
                    Singles Chart, where it stayed for forty-one weeks.[18] To date in the U.S., the single has sold
                    1,632,137 in digital downloads, and was certified
                    platinum by the RIAA when it crossed the one-million mark in sales. After a month of release, the
                    single peaked at #17 on the Australian ARIA Top 40 Digital Track Chart on November 19, 2006.

Critical
                    Reception

Continuum received
                    generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out
                    of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 18
                    reviews.[25] Matt Collar of Allmusic called it
                    "a gorgeously produced, brilliantly stripped-to-basics album that incorporates blues,
                    soft-funk, R&amp;B, folk and pop in a sound that is totally owned by Mayer."[5] Mojo called it
                    a "great blue-eyed soul record."[2] Ann Powers of
                    the Los Angeles Times commented that Mayer is "best when treading softly, finding the fluid
                    heart of blue-eyed soul", rather than on more "angst"-filled songs.[20] Bryan
                    Borzykowski of Now felt that "[Mayer's] melodic
                    voice, warm production, complex riffs and thoughtful lyrics should cure the violent reactions Mayer's
                    name used to evoke."[26] MSN Music's Robert Christgau gave Continuum a three-star
                    honorable mention ((3-star Honorable Mention)),[27]
                    indicating "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual
                    vision may well treasure".[28] He cited "Waiting on the World to Change" and "The
                    Heart of Life" as highlights and quipped,
                    "Saying in so many words what his less-gifted, more-pretentious contemporaries think it's
                    cool to camouflage".[27] Anthony DeCurtis, writing in Rolling Stone, called it "a smart,
                    breezy album that deftly fuses his love for
                    old-school blues and R&amp;B with his natural gift for sharp melodies and well-constructed songs."[22]
                    The magazine later ranked it the eleventh best album of 2006.[29]

In a mixed review, Slant
                    Magazine's Jonathan Keefe wrote that,
                    "with no edge to the songwriting and with such spit-polished, tasteful production, Continuum
                    just doesn't convince as a heady, soulful rock album or as Mayer's creative quantum leap
                    forward".[23] Jody Rosen, writing for
                    Entertainment Weekly, felt that Mayer is too "classy" and wrote that, although the songs
                    are "shapely" and "the musicianship is elegant and virtuosic", the music's
                    "low-key loveliness dissipates into a
                    sleep-inducing soft-rock haze."[3] Stylus Magazine stated that Mayer "calmly circles the
                    same career themes with the same warmed-over, palatable guitar weavings".[24] Q magazine called
                    it "dour stuff reminiscent of a yogic
                    Sting."[21]

					<summary>Heavier Things is the second major label studio album by singer-songwriter/guitarist John
                    Mayer, released in 2003. Since his successful debut album, 2001's Room for Squares, Mayer had
                    gained popularity as a creative and thoughtful
                    songwriter, and this characteristic shines through on Heavier Things. The title of the album itself
                    is a subtle response to certain criticism of Mayer's music.

The album debuted at
                    number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling
                    317,000 copies in its first week. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayer/Heavier+Things"&gt;Read

					<content>Heavier Things is the second major label studio album by singer-songwriter/guitarist John
                    Mayer, released in 2003. Since his successful debut album, 2001's Room for Squares, Mayer had
                    gained popularity as a creative and thoughtful
                    songwriter, and this characteristic shines through on Heavier Things. The title of the album itself
                    is a subtle response to certain criticism of Mayer's music.

The album debuted at
                    number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling
                    317,000 copies in its first week.[3] Despite some negative criticism towards Mayer's
                    songwriting, Heavier Things received generally positive reviews from music critics.

Background:
Mayer
                    felt he could be more relaxed and focus more
                    on his art while making Heavier Things. With Jack Joseph Puig as producer, loops and horns were more
                    prominently featured.[4] Mayer took greater control of the creative side with this album; much of
                    the album was recorded in his New York City
                    apartment.[5] He also got final approval on all radio-edits.[4]

Columbia Records used a
                    conservative marketing campaign to promote the album. Columbia Records Group president Will Botwin
                    says. "We think we're being smart. It's
                    a long-term project. We understand what we're creating is a career. Effectively, that's
                    the message: Keep the hype at bay."[4] In keeping with that gameplan, the album's first
                    single, "Bigger Than My Body", only went to
                    radio a few weeks before the album's release; promotional broadcasts of the album were limited
                    to MTV.com and Mayer's official site, both of whom began streaming the complete album the
                    September 2 before its release. Scheduled television
                    appearances included Saturday Night Live on Oct. 4 and several late shows.[4]Columbia Records
                    thought it was important to put Mayer in talk show-type scenarios before the album release to help
                    bring focus to his art and to his singer/songwriter
                    career; to steer away from the fame and celebrity hype.[6]

Singles

Despite being
                    "delayed" on the radio, the lead single "Bigger Than My Body" gained commercial
                    and critical success. "Clarity" was the
                    second single released from Heavier Things. Although the song usually receives rare radioplay, it is
                    one of Mayer's fan favorites, and is normally performed at Mayer's concerts. The song
                    received very positive reviews from critics, mostly
                    being praised for its relaxing style and beat.

"Daughters" was the last single
                    released from Heavier Things. The song has become a huge commercial success, and has received
                    largely positive reviews: many critics have hailed the
                    song as Mayer's best yet.

Upon its release, the album received generally positive
                    reviews from music critics; it holds an aggregate score of 67/100 at Metacritic.[12] Billboard
                    magazine stated that it "firmly establishes him as a
                    legitimate--albeit still puppy-eyed--singer/songwriter."[17] Chicago Tribune writer Allison
                    Stewart gave the album a favorable review and wrote that Mayer "[has] crafted a sturdy, soulful
                    pop album that credibly expands upon — but never
                    abandons — his core sound".[2] Despite writing that "his self-conscious lyrics can get in
                    the way", Russell Baillie of The New Zealand Herald praised Mayer's musicianship and gave
                    the album 4 out of 5 stars.[18] Rolling Stone
                    magazine's James Hunter called Heavier Things an "equally available yet more sophisticated
                    album" than Room for Squares.[14] In his own review for Esquire, Mayer gave the album a "B
                    minus", adding, "Am I the only one who
                    finds this record creepy to make out to?"[19] Spin said, "Sadly, Mayer's idea of a
                    good time involves hiring jazz musicians to make himself sound like '80s James Taylor.

Accolades

Mayer
                    earned his first
                    number-one single with "Daughters" as well as a 2005 Grammy for Song of the Year, beating
                    out fellow contenders Alicia Keys and Kanye West. He dedicated the award to his grandmother, Annie
                    Hoffman, who died in May 2004. He also won Best
                    Male Pop Vocal Performance, beating Elvis Costello, Prince, and Seal for the award. At the 37th
                    Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in 2006, Mayer was honored with the Hal David
                    Starlight Award.[20]

					<summary>Room for Squares is the first major-label album by John Mayer, released commercially on
                    September 18, 2001.

The album's title is an inside joke/reference to Hank Mobley's
                    No Room for Squares album. 
Most of the songs
                    from the album were written by Mayer; however, three of the songs, "No Such Thing", "Neon",
                    and "Love Song for No One", were all co-written with Clay Cook, with whom Mayer had a duo
                    group known as "The LoFi
                    Masters".

The album was relatively unknown at its time of release, but it became more
                    well-known through word of mouth and Mayer's touring. By the end of 2002, Room for Squares had
                    spawned several radio hits, including "No
                    Such Thing", "Your Body Is a Wonderland", and ultimately,"Why Georgia" (a
                    radio-only single). &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Mayer/Room+for+Squares"&gt;Read

				<summary>There are two artists with the name John Mayer; American pop singer-songwriter John Clayton Mayer
                (b. 1977), and Anglo-Indian Composer John Jiddhu Mayer (1930 - 2004) and leader of John Mayer's

1) John Clayton
                Mayer was born October 16, 1977, in Fairfield, Connecticut, USA, and started playing guitar at 13 after
                being inspired by a Stevie Ray Vaughan tape his neighbor gave him. In 1998 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia
                where he refined his skills and gained a

                Indo Jazz Fusions

1) John Clayton
                Mayer was born October 16, 1977, in Fairfield, Connecticut, USA, and started playing guitar at 13 after
                being inspired by a Stevie Ray Vaughan tape his neighbor gave him. In 1998 he moved to Atlanta, Georgia
                where he refined his skills and gained a
                following.

In 2003, he won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the 2002
                single "Your Body Is a Wonderland" from the album Room for Squares.

In February 2005,
                he was awarded the Song of the Year Grammy
                for his song Daughters, which he composed while in the shower, from the album Heavier Things. In winning
                the award, he beat out such contenders as Alicia Keys, and Kanye West. He dedicated this award to his
                grandmother, Annie Hoffman, who died in May
                2004. He also won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for which Elvis Costello, Prince and Seal were also
                nominated. In 2007, John won 2 Grammys, one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for the song "Waiting
                On The World To Change," and also
                Best Pop Vocal Album for his album Continuum.

To date, Mayer has toured with many groups,
                including Maroon 5, Guster, Counting Crows, The Wallflowers, Teitur, Ben Folds, and Sheryl Crow.

In
                2004, Mayer worked with hip hop artist and
                producer Kanye West, appearing both on Go and Kanye West's Bittersweet (released in the summer of
                2007 as an iTunes pre-order bonus track to the album Graduation) and received praise from rap
                heavyweights like Jay-Z and Nelly. When asked about
                his ubiquitous presence in the hip hop community, he said, "It's not music out there right
                now. That's why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be."

It was around this time
                that he began hinting at a change in his
                musical interests, announcing that he was "closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity." In 2005,
                he began a string of collaborations with various blues artists, including Buddy Guy, BB King, Eric
                Clapton and jazz artist John Scofield. He also
                toured with the legendary jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, which included a show at the Bonnaroo Music
                Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.

Although Mayer has maintained a reputation for being a
                sensitive singer-songwriter, he is also an
                accomplished guitarist influenced by the likes of Jimi Hendrix, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Eric Clapton, Buddy
                Guy, Freddie King and B.B. King. In this regard, he has released an album with his band The John Mayer
                Trio Try!, which features a blues-rock
                style reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix.

In September 2006, Mayer released his third studio album,
                Continuum. The album, written and produced exclusively by Mayer (with the help of Steve Jordan from the
                John Mayer Trio) is a culmination of
                Mayer's growth as an artist and continues with the blues-rock style that he began to flirt with on
                Try!.

Also notable is John Mayer's various adaptations in style. He always maintained a
                blues tone, he introduced a rockier edge.
                However, in Continuum, he adopts a calmer genre, returning to his previous styles. 

On November
                17, 2009, Mayer's fourth studio album, Battle Studies, was released and debuted at number one on
                the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart. The
                album consists of 11 tracks with a total time of 45 minutes. The first single from the album, "Who
                Says", was released on September 24, 2009 in advance of album, and was followed on October 19 by
                the single "Heartbreak Warfare"
                and the single "Half of My Heart" released on June 21, 2010. Despite the album's
                commercial success, critics were mixed with their praise; while some reviews were glowing, calling it
                his "most adventurous", others called the
                album "safe" and noted that "Mayer the singer-songwriter and Mayer the man about town
                sometimes seem disconnected, like they don't even belong in the same body.

Following his
                recovery from vocal surgery, Mayer returned to
                the studio. On June 18, 2013, Mayer announced from his Facebook page that his sixth album, Paradise
                Valley, would be released on August 13, 2013. On the same day, he released a lyric video for the new
                album's first single, "Paper
                Doll", on his YouTube page. The release date was later changed to August 20, 2013. "Who You
                Love" featuring Katy Perry followed as the album's third single and a music video was released
                on December 17, 2013 for the song. The
                album, which also includes a collaboration with Frank Ocean, was met with positive reviews from music
                critics. Mayer embarked on a tour, his first in three years, in support of Born and Raised and Paradise
                Valley. The American leg of the tour ran
                from July to December 2013 with Interscope recording artist Phillip Phillips serving as support act. The
                tour will visit Australia in April 2014.



2) John Jiddhu Mayer (b. Calcutta, Bengal,
                British India, October 28, 1930; d. United
                Kingdom, March 9, 2004) was an Indian composer known primarily for his fusions of jazz with Indian
                music. He was born into an Anglo-Indian family and, after studying with Phillipe Sandre in Calcutta and
                Melhi Mehta in Bombay, he won a scholarship to
                London's Royal Academy of Music in 1952, where he studied comparative music and religion in eastern
                and western cultures.

He worked as a violinist with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1953-58)
                and then with the Royal Philharmonic
                Orchestra (1958-65), but was also composing fusions of Hindustani classical and Western classical forms
                from 1952 onwards. His Violin Sonata was performed by Yehudi Menuhin in 1955.
In the 1960s he worked
                extensively with the Jamaican jazz
                musician Joe Harriott, with whom he formed the group Indo-Jazz Fusions, a ten-piece featuring a jazz
                quintet and five Indian musicians. The new incarnation of the band, called John Mayer's Indo Jazz
                Fusions, was revived in the 1990s and
                continued to play live gigs -- featuring Mayer's son Jonathan Mayer on sitar -- until John Mayer's
                death.

From 1996 onwards, Mayer, though based in north London, worked part-time as
                composer-in-residence at the Birmingham
                Conservatoire where he introduced the BMus Indian music course in 1997.

Albums include
                Indo-Jazz Fusions I &amp; II, Dhammapada, Etudes &amp; Radha Krishna, and Asian Airs.

				<summary>Khalid is American singer/songwriter from El Paso, Texas. He burst onto the music scene with his
                first single "Location", which received great critical acclaim and praised for his soulful,
                gentle and mellifluous voice perfectly
                suitable for retro soul. Started when only 18, fresh from the halls of high school, his music is full of
                youthful innocence and poetic passion. Khalid released his debut album American Teen on March 3, 2017
                via Right Hand Music Group/RCA Records,

					<content>DNA is the debut studio album by British girl group Little Mix. It was released on 19 November
                    2012 in the United Kingdom via Syco Music. The group began work recording the album in December 2011
                    and concluded in September 2012. Throughout
                    the recording process, Little Mix worked with several producers, including TMS, Future Cut, Steve
                    Mac, Jarrad Rogers, Richard "Biff" Stannard, Ash Howes, Jon Levine, Xenomania, Fred Ball
                    and Pegasus. The album was co-written by Little Mix
                    and they stated that they were involved in the development of the album as much as possible.
                    Sonically, the album is primarily a mixture of pop and R&amp;B records, with influences from
                    dance-pop, pop rock and hip hop found on specific songs as well.
                    The album's lyrical content explores empowerment, relationships and heartbreak. Songs on the
                    album were also co-written by members of other girl groups, including Nicola Roberts of Girls Aloud,
                    Shaznay Lewis of All Saints and T-Boz of
                    TLC.

DNA received mixed reviews from music critics. The album's lead single, "Wings",
                    was released on 26 August 2012, reaching number one in UK and Ireland as well as charting in
                    Australia, New Zealand, Slovakia, Czech
                    Republic, Hungary, Belgium, Canada and the US. The second single, "DNA", was released on
                    11 November 2012, peaking at number three in the UK. Two post-album singles were released: "Change
                    Your Life" on 3 February 2013, and a remix
                    of "How Ya Doin'?" featuring American rapper Missy Elliott was released on 17 April
                    2013; both songs reached the top 20 in the UK.

The album charted in the top 5 in eight
                    countries, including number three in the UK, and at
                    number four on the US Billboard 200; making Little Mix the first girl group since Danity Kane in
                    2006 to reach the top 5 with their debut album, as well as earning the highest debut Billboard chart
                    position by a British girl group, breaking the
                    record previously held by the Spice Girls' debut album Spice (1996). &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Mix/DNA:+The+Deluxe+Edition"&gt;Read

"Shout Out to My Ex"
                    was released on 16 October 2016, as the album's lead single. The song was premiered on the day

On 1 March 2017,
                    the group announced they would release "No More
                    Sad Songs" as the third single from the album, on 3 March 2017. The new mix of the song will

                    of the single's release, they announced that the single release of "Power" would be
                    remixed, with an added feature from English grime
                    act Stormzy.

The critical reception was great. The Guardian called the album "chart
                    pop perfection." In another positive review, Digital Spy wrote "Little Mix have put
                    together their most personal album yet, without
                    sacrificing big hooks, a mainstream pop sensibility and plenty of sassy attitude." The article
                    continued by saying "Glory Days hears four young women come together with a very real bond,
                    making their message all the more believable."
                    The Evening Standard praised Little Mix for surviving with their fourth studio album, writing "Glory
                    Days mostly sticks to their winning formula", and adding that "the foursome have carved
                    out a pop niche for themselves." Digital
                    Spy considered Glory Days the 12th best album of the year. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Little+Mix/Glory+Days+(Deluxe)"&gt;Read

				<content>Little Mix (previously Rhythmix) are the 2011 winners of The X Factor, and the first ever group to
                win the grand prize. Their debut single, a cover of the Damien Rice ballad Cannonball was released
                digitally the morning after their win. The
                song was produced by Fazer, from the band N-Dubz. The lead single from their debut album, Wings, was
                released on August 19, 2012 and reached number 1 in the official UK charts. Their second single to be
                released was DNA, which was also the title of
                their debut album. The song DNA shows a slightly darker side of the girlband.

The band consists
                of Essex former-barmaid Jesy Nelson (20), High Wycombe former-waitress Leigh-Anne Pinnock (19), and
                South Shields former-students Perrie Edwards
                and Jade Thirlwall (both 18). The group was formed at the 2011 X Factor bootcamp in London from singers
                who auditioned as soloists. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Mix"&gt;Read more on

Originally the group started as family, who
                all had an interest in music. It
                wasn't until 2008 that this trio took their talent seriously, and put together and released their
                first project "Juug Season" in 2011. T​he group later released another mixtape titled "No
                Label" in 2012, which featured

Fast forward
                to 2013, the trio have released their newest project "Young Rich Niggas", which many fans call
                the "Mixtape of the Summer".
                The mixtape featured guest verses from fellow Atlanta artists such as; Trinidad Jame$, Gucci Mane,
                Soulja Boy, Que and even RiFF RAFF, who is a Houston native. Due to their rapid unforeseen success,
                Migos have even received a guest verse from Young
                Money artist, Drake, on one of the mixtape's most infectious tracks "Versace".

Migos
                have collaborated with the "Trap God" himself Gucci Mane and the "Street's Lottery"
                Young Scooter... not to mention,
                Migos have also received numerous co-signs from big names in the rap community such as DJ Drama, Juicy
                J, DJ Scream and Drake just to name a few. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Migos"&gt;Read

					<summary>Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded is the second studio album by Trinidadian-American recording artist
                    Nicki Minaj. It was released on April 2, 2012, by Young Money, Cash Money and Universal Republic.
                    Looking to transition from her debut studio
                    album, Pink Friday (2010), Minaj wanted to make a follow-up record about "just having fun".
                    Stylistically, the album is divided by a first half of hip-hop tracks and a second half of dance-pop
                    songs. As its executive producer, Minaj
                    enlisted a variety of collaborators. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nicki+Minaj/Pink+Friday+...+Roman+Reloaded"&gt;Read

				<content>Onika Tanya Maraj (born December 8, 1982 in Trinidad and Tobago but now lives in New York City, New
                York, United States), better known by her stage name Nicki Minaj, is a Trinidadian-American, rapper and
                singer-songwriter signed to a joint
                venture between Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment and Universal Motown. After releasing several
                mixtapes and building substantial buzz online her debut album, Pink Friday, was released on November 22,
                2010. In October 2010, Minaj became the
                first female rapper to have seven songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. 

Minaj has been
                creating mixtape tracks since 2004, and appeared in XXL magazine. In 2008 she won the Female Artist of
                the Year award at the Underground Music
                Awards.

Pink Friday's lead buzz track, Massive Attack, features singer-rapper Sean Garrett
                and was released on April 13th 2010, peaking at #19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers Songs chart. Your
                Love, the album's second single, was
                released on June 1st following a premature leak. The song peaked at #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at
                #1 on the Rap Songs chart, thus becoming Minaj's most successful single release at the time.

The
                follow up to Minaj's number
                one album Pink Friday, Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded also debuted at the top of the charts. The album
                contained the multi-platinum single Starships. Minaj's latest album The Pinkprint was released in

					<content>All the Right Reasons is the fifth studio album by Canadian rock band Nickelback, released on
                    October 4, 2005. It is the band's first album with former 3 Doors Down drummer Daniel Adair,
                    who replaced Ryan Vikedal in January 2005. The
                    album topped the Canadian Albums Chart and the American Billboard 200 albums chart and has sold over
                    11 million copies worldwide, according to certifications from the CRIA, the RIAA and the BPI. Seven
                    singles were released from the album, of which
                    four reached number one or two on the Canadian Singles Chart. The album re-entered the Finland
                    Albums Chart 5 years after its release, setting also a new peak position, at #21.

All the
                    Right Reasons was certified 8x Platinum by the RIAA on
                    October 7, 2009, making it one of the top 200 best-selling albums of all time in the US. In the US,
                    All the Right Reasons had sold 7,378,327 copies. In Canada All the Right Reasons was certified 7x
                    Platinum by the CRIA in March 2010.

The
                    album was the third straight No. 1 album for the band in their native Canada selling more than
                    60,000 copies in its first week topping their previous albums Silver Side Up and The Long Road which
                    also hit No. 1, "Silver Side Up" opened with
                    43,000 copies and "The Long Road" with 45,000 copies. In the United States the album to
                    date has sold over 6.8 million copies and was found again inside the top 10 of the Billboard 200 in
                    its 99th, 100th, 101st, and 102nd weeks on the
                    chart. The album had never been below #30 on the Billboard 200 in 110 weeks, making Nickelback the
                    first act to have an album in the top thirty of the Billboard 200 for its first 100 weeks since
                    Shania Twain's album, "Come on Over"
                    stayed in the top thirty for 123 consecutive weeks following its release. Billboard Magazine called
                    the album "the biggest rock album of the century so far."

In addition the album
                    has spawned five top twenty Hot 100 singles in the
                    U.S., ("Photograph", "Savin' Me", "Far Away", "If Everyone
                    Cared", and "Rockstar"), making it one of only a handful of rock albums to ever
                    produce five or more top twenty U.S. hits.
                    "Photograph", "Far Away", and "Rockstar" were all top ten singles on
                    the Hot 100, making Nickelback the first rock band of 2000s to have three top ten hits from the same
                    album.

In the UK, the album opened its
                    chart run at #13 before quickly leaving the top 75 with no top 20 singles, with "Savin' Me"
                    being their first to miss the top 75 altogether. While being their smallest-selling UK album since
                    "Curb", it experienced, in early
                    2008, a resurrection due to the single "Rockstar" becoming Nickelback's highest
                    charting single ever in the UK. The album has now outpeaked its previous peak of #13, reaching #2
                    and has since been certified Platinum

It was
                    ranked #13 on Billboard's 200 Albums of the Decade.

In contrast to its high sales, All
                    the Right Reasons received a "mixed to negative score" of 41 based on 9 critics and a 4.2
                    out of 10 from users on Metacritic, making it the
                    21st lowest rated album since records on the site began. The album also jump started the worldwide
                    hatred-phenomenon towards Nickelback and their music. Despite the mostly negative reviews,
                    Entertainment Weekly explained the album's success this
                    way: "What if Nickelback's decision to let the music speak for itself is, ironically,
                    their biggest selling point of all?"

The special edition of this album was released on
                    July 10, 2007. It features in 2-Disc set: Exclusive
                    live bonus track, ringtone of "Photograph", Nickelback wallpaper plus three unreleased
                    live tracks and one remix version of "Photograph". Bonus DVD includes four videos,
                    behind-the-scenes tour diary and interviews.

                    Again" – the most successful being "How You Remind Me", which reached #1 in the

                    charts. Nickelback was named #1 Most Played Rock Artist of 2002 Across All Radio Formats. Despite
                    never being released as a single, "Woke Up This Morning" was played frequently during the
                    All the Right Reasons Tour and on the

                    fifth track entitled 'Just For' was originally recorded on Nickelback's debut album
                    Curb under the title "Just Four".

The seventh track entitled 'Money Bought'
                    was originally planned to be the theme song of
                    the new WWE Pay-Per-View "Money In Bank" but eventually it went to "Money" by I
                    Fight Dragons. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nickelback/Silver+Side+Up"&gt;Read

The
                band consists of Chad Kroeger (vocals, guitar), Ryan Peake (guitar, vocals), Mike Kroeger (bass) and
                Daniel Adair (drums). The
                band's original drummer, Brandon Kroeger, left the group in 1997, and was replaced first by Mitch
                Guidon from 1997 to 1998 and then Ryan Vikedal from 1998 to 2005. The band has released seven albums:
                "Curb" (1996), "The
                State" (1998), "Silver Side Up" (2001), "The Long Road" (2003), "All the
                Right Reasons", "Dark Horse" (2008) and "Here and Now" (2011).

The
                band is now based in Vancouver, British
                Columbia, Canada. Its name originates from the nickel in change that band member Mike Kroeger gave
                customers at his Starbucks job, he would frequently say, "Here's your nickel back".

The
                band is signed to EMI in Canada and
                Roadrunner Records for the rest of the world. In July 2008, the band signed with Live Nation for three
                touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth cycle. The contract includes recordings, touring,
                merchandise and other
                rights.


Early years: 1995–2000

The band was formed in the early 1990s as a cover
                band called the "Village Idiots" by Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake, Mike Kroeger, and Brandon
                Kroeger. The band performed covers of songs from
                Led Zeppelin and Metallica. Nickelback's first release was a seven-track EP called Hesher in 1996.
                In the same year, Nickelback recorded their first full-length album Curb. "Fly" was released
                on Hesher and Curb and was the first single
                produced by Nickelback. It did not chart and was only played on local radio stations.

The
                following album The State was recorded in 1998 and was released as an independent record the same year.
                Nickelback signed a record deal with EMI and
                Roadrunner Records. The State was then re-released in 2000 by EMI and Roadrunner Records. Two singles
                from the album, "Leader of Men" and "Breathe" were fairly successful and resulted in
                the album being certificated gold in Canada
                and the United States. It was certified Platinum in 2008.

Mainstream success: 2001–2007

In
                2001, Nickelback released the Silver Side Up album, which propelled them into the mainstream. The single
                "How You Remind Me" was a
                huge success, peaking at #1 on both the American and Canadian charts at the same time. In the U.S., it
                was a #1 single on the Mainstream and Modern rock charts, as well as the pop chart. It also peaked at #2
                on Adult Top 40. "How You Remind
                Me" became the Billboard Hot 100 #1 single of the year for 2002. The next single was "Too Bad",
                which also hit #1 on the Mainstream Rock Chart and had a small amount of success on the pop chart. The
                final single from the album was
                "Never Again", another #1 hit on Mainstream Rock.

In 2002, Chad Kroeger collaborated
                with Josey Scott and Gaige Corvo who played the lead guitar on the Spider-Man theme song, "Hero."
                This also featured Tyler Connolly,
                Mike Kroeger, Matt Cameron, and Jeremy Taggart.

In 2003, Nickelback released The Long Road. The
                lead single was "Someday" and the album went on to sell five million copies worldwide. The
                band also released "Feelin' Way
                Too Damn Good" as a single, which peaked at #3 on the Mainstream Rock Charts. "Figured You Out"
                was also released as a single and topped the Mainstream Rock Charts for 13 consecutive weeks.

Nickelback's
                fifth studio
                album, All the Right Reasons, produced five U.S. Hot 100 top 20 singles: "Photograph", "Savin'
                Me", "Far Away", "If Everyone Cared", "Rockstar". Three of these
                became U.S. Hot 100 top 10 singles.
                All the Right Reasons has sold 7,163,130 copies in the US as of June 13, 2009. In total, All the Right
                Reasons has sold abut 11 million copies worldwide since its 2005 release. Aside from all the success of
                All the Right Reasons, lead singer Kroeger
                began his own label named 604 Records in 2005 and holds the position of executive producer.

Dark
                Horse 2008-2010

After taking much of 2007 off, the band started recording a new album in
                earnest. In July 2008, the band signed with
                Live Nation for three touring and album cycles, with an option for a fourth. 

On September 4,
                2008 Roadrunner Records announced that the first single from their upcoming album was originally going
                to be "If Today Was Your Last Day"
                and was to be released September 30, 2008. However, the song was scrapped as the first single, and
                "Gotta Be Somebody" was the lead single instead. The new album, titled Dark Horse, was
                released on November 18, 2008. The album was produced
                by Mutt Lange. Something in Your Mouth was released as the second single to rock radio only on December
                15, where it reached #1. "If Today Was Your Last Day" was released as the second major single
                instead. Two more singles have been
                released,"I'd Come for You" and "Burn It to the Ground".

The album
                also remained in the top 20 on the Billboard 200 for weeks after its release. The album was certified
                two times platinum in April 2009, and had by
                April 2010 sold over 3 million copies in the U.S. However, critical reception of the album has been
                mostly mixed to negative. In 2009, the band won three Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, group of
                the year, and album of the year; the band
                performed their single "Something In Your Mouth" at the ceremony. In 2010, Billboard year end
                charts listed Dark Horse as the top-selling rock and metal album of the year. The band was also listed
                at the top selling hard rock artist. On
                January 29, 2010 they released a Tap-Tap rhythm game for on the App Store, contrary to the band's
                prior comments against other music related video games such as Guitar Hero. On February 28, 2010,
                Nickelback gave a performance at the beginning of
                the concert portion of the 2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony, performing "Burn It to the Ground".
                On October 2010 Nickelback finished their Dark Horse Tour.

Here and Now 2011-present
Chad
                Kroeger said in an interview with
                Billboard.com in September 2010 that songwriting for the next Nickelback album was planned to commence
                as early as February 2011 with "about four tunes" already in mind. Adair mentioned that the
                band wanted to go back to the musical style
                of All The Right Reasons, which he described as "more organic."

Nickelback announced
                their new album, Here and Now, on September 8, 2011, along with its two lead singles, "Bottoms Up"
                and "When We Stand
                Together". Kroeger said “We’re four people who love making music, the way we like to make it. We
                entered the studio this year with a vision, and it all came together. We’re extremely happy with the
                results, and can’t wait to share them with our
                fans.” The album was released on November 21, 2011, with the band calling it "Nickelblack Monday",
                a play on Nickelback and Black Monday. Two singles were released to radio stations on September 26, and
                September 27 for purchase on
                iTunes.

Here and Now peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, selling 226,714 copies in its
                first week of release, with Christmas by Michael Bublé taking number one by a margin of only 419 copies

According
                to an interview with
                Chad Kroeger, the band planned to release a greatest hits album in 2013 and a new album in 2014. The
                band officially announced the compilation album The Best of Nickelback Volume 1 through social media on
                October 3, 2013. Frontman Chad Kroeger had
                previously stated in an interview that the greatest hits album was to feature songs from previous albums
                along with new songs but the unveiled track listing ultimately contained only previously released
                material.

Criticism

In
                various points in their career, Nickelback has received widespread negative reviews from various
                sources. Review aggregator Metacritic reports the three of their most recent studio albums since
                becoming a mainstream act, The Long Road, All the Right
                Reasons and Dark Horse, to have scores of 62%, 41% and 49% respectively.

They have at times,
                been ridiculed for their lack of originality. In 2001, Rolling Stone criticised the band's musical
                style, saying, "if you're looking
                for originality, you might want a full refund instead of a Nickelback." Rolling Stone also said
                their 2003 release, The Long Road, was "Brazenly consistent, if unimaginative." Whilst
                Allmusic also stated, "Nickelback can now
                afford a little more time in the studio and a little more time to indulge themselves, and they turn out
                the same record, only slicker, which only highlights just how oppressively and needlessly sullen this
                group is."

In 2005, Rolling
                Stone said "All the Right Reasons is so depressing, you're almost glad Kurt's not around
                to hear it." Tiny Mix Tapes also expressed concern over the release; "Like all Nickelback
                releases before it, All The Right Reasons was
                made for all the wrong ones and follows all the formulas and clichés you should be bored to death of by
                now." Stephen Thomas Erlewin of Allmusic reviewed Dark Horse, claiming that "Nickelback are a
                gnarled, vulgar band reveling in their
                ignorance of the very notion of taste, lacking either the smarts or savvy to wallow in bad taste so they
                just get ugly, knocking out knuckle-dragging riffs that seem rarefied in comparison to their thick,
                boneheaded words."

Despite a
                barrage from critics, Nickelback has still managed to please various sources with each of their
                mainstream albums. Allmusic reviewer Liana Jones complimented Nickelback after their commercial
                breakthrough, Silver Side Up; "what gives the group
                an upper hand over its peers is intensity and raw passion... Nickelback ups the ante by offering
                realistic storytelling that listeners can relate to." Following their 2008 album, Dark Horse,
                ChartAttack credited the band's success to
                knowing their target audience, "Chad Kroeger is a genius because he knows exactly what people want
                and precisely how far he can go. He turned out an extremely racy album that's loaded with songs
                about gettin' drunk and doin' it
                all without breaking any taboos, and with enough love and moral authority to grease its passage into the
                mainstream. Rejoice, North America. This is your world." Billboard also praised the band; "The
                bulletproof Nickelback provides
                affordable fun that promises good returns in hard times."

In 2007, USA Today reported that
                "few bands inspire such intense hatred as Nickelback." The article questioned whether
                Nickelback's commercial success made
                "critics wrong", and published multiple statements from various sources within the music
                industry. Nathan Brackett, a senior editor at Rolling Stone said, "There are some bands that, let's
                face it, are critic-proof". Both
                Brackett and Craig Marks, editor in chief of Blender, credit a lot of the band's success to young
                people who are introduced to them on the radio and "very casual music fans who don't buy a lot
                of CDs". Marks complimented
                Nickelback's popularity despite the critical response, saying "it is a tribute to their
                success."

                Edition was released on January 26, 2010,[1] and features three new tracks and a remix of "Hello
                Seattle". The album features guest vocals by
                Relient K vocalist, Matt Thiessen, on the songs "Fireflies", "Cave In", "The
                Bird and the Worm" and "Tidal Wave".

On July 14, 2009, the song "Fireflies"
                was chosen as the Single of the Week
                by the iTunes music store. This led to a huge success as the song was downloaded over 650,000 times and
                helped the album reach #2 on the US store. This success also led to the record company pushing back the
                release date of the physical copy of the
                album from July 28, 2009 to September 1, 2009.[2] Adam Young, a.k.a. Owl City told The Sun that "Cave
                In" was especially dear to his heart as "that song captures in just a few words, all my hopes
                and dreams."[3] The album sold
                approximately 18,000 copies digitally in its debut week. The album has sold around 609,000 copies and
                reached the top ten in the US peaking at #8. The same week its lead single "Fireflies" topped
                the Billboard Hot 100. Eventually, Ocean
                Eyes climbed to number one on iTunes after the album price was lowered for a limited period of time.

The
                album has slightly modified versions of songs from previous albums, namely "Hello Seattle"
                from Of June and "On The
                Wing" and "The Saltwater Room" from Maybe I'm Dreaming.

Ocean Eyes has
                received mixed reviews from critics, based on a Metacritic score of 50/100. The album gained some
                positive reviews, including Entertainment Weekly
                which gave it a B+ and said that it was filled with catchy choruses and that the highlight was "Dental
                Care". Jesus Freak Hideout also was favorable; the review highlighted the album's style of
                music, saying that it had "dreamy
                lyrics and open soundscapes." However, Rolling Stone claimed Ocean Eyes to be disappointing, only
                awarding it 2/5 stars. They especially criticized the slower songs, saying that tracks like "On the
                Wing" were "just mush".
                Allmusic gave the album an average rating of 2.5/5. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Owl+City/Ocean+Eyes"&gt;Read

				<content>The Midsummer Station is the fourth studio album by American synthpop project Owl City and was
                released on August 17, 2012. Regarding the The Midsummer Station album title, Young told AOL Music that
                it is, "Purely imagery." He
                explained: "To me it's like, I have this place in my head that is ambiguous and safe. It's
                this idealist, surreal, perfect world. I think everyone needs that." (Good Time Songfacts). 

After
                Owl City's previous album,
                All Things Bright and Beautiful (2011) sold only 143,000 copies in the United States, Adam Young began
                working on demo tracks for The Midsummer Station in January 2012. Unlike his previous albums, Young
                worked with different songwriters and producers
                for the first time, including Stargate, Emily Wright, and Matthew Thiessen. Young was initially scared
                of the thought of collaborating with others, "I've never worked with anybody before. I've
                done everything myself except for
                mastering. It's a big job for one guy, especially a perfectionist, so I knew I wanted to try to
                experiment with other people."
On May 15, 2012, Young released the Shooting Star EP, which
                consisted of four songs that would be featured on
                The Midsummer Station. Many criticized the EP, saying it was very different from Young's previous
                works. On his blog, Young defended his choice for the new sound of the EP and the album, stating that he
                believes "it's a bummer for an
                artist of any kind to hear, 'Yeah it's great but it's a lot like your previous work.'
                (...) Creativity is all about pushing boundaries and pressing onward". In an interview with
                PureVolume, Young stated that the tracks on
                this record are much darker, with more influence of his own dreams, nightmares and self-reflection.[7]
                The EP's title track, "Shooting Star" was intended to be the lead single from The
                Midsummer Station, but the Carly Rae
                Jepsen-collaboration "Good Time" was chosen instead, due to the success of Jepsen's
                "Call Me Maybe". "Good Time" was released on June 26, 2012, and has so far peaked at
                No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100.
The album
                was originally planned to have a release date of August 14, 2012 worldwide, apart from the United
                Kingdom where it would be released on September 17, 2012. On June 21, 2012, it was announced that the
                worldwide release date would be pushed back to
                August 21, 2012. On July 12, 2012, Young announced via Twitter that the UK release date would be brought
                forward to August 20, 2012. The album was released on August 17 in other countries including Australia.

The
                album received generally
                good reviews. It holds a 61/100 on Metacritic.

The album opened up at No. 1 on iTunes.

				<content>Portugal. The Man is an experimental indie rock four-piece centered on frontman John Baldwin
                Gourley’s abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing. He was raised in a sort of
                technological isolation: his log cabin home in the
                winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both
                of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal
                darkness and perpetual cold with their
                jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley’s innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination
                with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is
                always open to interpretation and change.
                

Even though members were born in Alaska, the band formed in Portland, Oregon, USA, in 2004
                with the union of Gourley (vocals, guitar, organ, machines) and his childhood friend Zachary Scott
                Carothers (Bass, percussion, vocals) after the
                break-up of their band Anatomy Of A Ghost. Jason Sechrist (Drums and Gang) of Portland, OR joined in
                2005. Current lineup includes Ryan Neighbors (Piano, Rhodes, Organ, Synth, Vocals). They are however
                known for fluidity in both their music and their
                lineup and often feature guest appearances.

The band’s debut album, Waiter: “You Vultures!” was
                released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006.

On June 22, 2007 they released their second
                full length, Church Mouth. The band then
                set out on a full US tour with support from The Photo Atlas, Play Radio Play, Tera Melos, and The Only
                Children. They then toured Europe, and followed it up with another US headlining tour with support from
                Rocky Votolato and Great Depression during
                September and October. Following this tour, they joined Thursday on a short east coast tour in November
                alongside Circle Takes the Square.

Portugal. The Man collaborated with the band The Sound of
                Animals Fighting on the re-release of their
                first album, “Tiger and the Duke.” Portugal. The Man remixed three of the songs on that album.

                independent record label, Approaching
                AIRballoons, with a partnership with EQUAL VISION RECORDS. The album was released September 16, 2008.

As
                of October 2009, It was announced through Twitter that Portugal. The Man have completed another album
                entitled “American Ghetto” which combines their progressive rock style from their latter albums with
                some of the electo style from their “Its
                Complicated Being A Wizard” release. A listening party was held for a group of 17 fans in Los Angeles
                CA. The album was released on March 2, 2010. 

The Got it All (This Can’t Be Living Now)
                Songfacts reports the band’s sixth album and first
                for Atlantic, In the Mountain in the Cloud, was released on July 19, 2011.

It was last spring
                2012, and John Gourley—frontman of Portugal. The Man—found himself in New York City about to ring the
                bell at Danger Mouse’s apartment--a long way
                from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length
                albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella,
                Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza—up until this moment,
                Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range. 

When it came time to begin work
                on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one
                concept: The most satisfying work is
                collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had
                sought partnerships. So he took a bold step — bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty
                of sound — a step up to the apartment of a
                possible collaborator, Danger Mouse.

“I walked into his place,” Gourley remembers now. “And it
                wasn’t going to happen. He was like, ‘Hey, man, just so you know, I don’t really want to record a rock
                band.’ And I was a little relieved. We’d
                done this by ourselves before, and we knew we could do it by ourselves again.”

But then they
                got to listening, and to talking about how much Danger Mouse had loved In the Mountain in the Cloud —
                the 2011 followup to Portugal. The Man’s break
                out record The Satanic Satanist. “From that very first meeting,” says Danger Mouse, “we were very
                ambitious about what we could do…otherwise there was no point. So we decided: Let’s try and make
                something really special.”

So Danger Mouse —
                aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and
                Beck to The Black Keys and now U2 —and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began
                production on what would become Evil
                Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations
                melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After
                all, here was a band with an evolving lineup
                — Kyle O’Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar/percussion/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums
                joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar — building new songs with
                a new producer trying to do something neither
                of them had done before.

They went, together, to Los Angeles and worked through several
                sessions — at Mondo Studios, Eltro Vox Studios, and Kingsize Soundlabs. The band worked months longer
                than they ever had on one thing. And somehow —
                maybe it was the collaboration in the air, or maybe sheer will — they finally stopped searching and
                started realizing: “What really brought our record together was getting past that period of looking for
                something, and figuring out how to do
                something really new, really hard, and really satisfying,” said Gourley.

Each track on Evil
                Friends is as different from the next as Portugal. The Man’s previous records were from each other,
                which is to say a piece of a growing mindscape,
                and wholly a part of the group’s tumbling fever dream. Where the 2009 hit People Say was a cheery guitar
                rally, the new title track is a bells-and-balls ballad emerging from darkness into a pipe-whistling
                punky thump, albeit with Gourley’s trademark
                falsetto and thundering guitar. And yet here is Evil Friends swirling, like a tornado that sends a
                napping child toward Oz, into something of a tale of Portugal. The Man’s arousal from when it decided to
                make something special to when it actually
                did: The weighted down questions of “Plastic Soldiers” (Could it be we got lost in the summer? / Well I
                know you know that it’s over) give way to the confident melodies of “Modern Jesus” (The only rule we
                need is never giving up / The only faith we
                have is faith in us) and finally, brazenly, to the anthem “Smile” (We watched the sun come up / But took
                it down to hide it / Seems like the spring has come and gone / It felt like forever).

It took
                all year, and Portugal. The Man — a group
                guaranteed for seven years to pump out a record, to tour and tour and tour, to tuck its fans to bed at
                night with a community of psychedelic rock — had learned to slow down and transform all-day, all-night
                recording with Danger Mouse into adrenaline,
                into words that are at once dark and light, into sounds that are overlapping with danger and charm. The
                whole “evil friends” thing was just a happy writing accident, by the way, a lyrical coincidence belying
                a collaborative friendship Burton says
                taught him, too: “I felt like I was watching them do something special and I wanted to let them do it,
                so sometimes I was more hands-on, but sometimes more hands-off than I had been with anyone,” says Danger
                Mouse. “They had done enough albums that I
                thought it would be fun to shake it up a little bit.”

“In the beginning, I asked Brian why he
                had wanted to talk about making a record,” recalls Gourley. “And he admitted that he was surprised when
                he saw us live. ‘I didn’t know you guys
                could sound like that.’ There had been this perception that we’ve been something else — and I’ve noticed
                it, at festivals, everywhere — that we were something we were not. But then we got in a room with Danger
                Mouse, to the place where we could just
                throw that out, wake up and say, Here we are. We’re this band! Let’s just make it, together.”

					<content>All We Know Is Falling is the debut studio album by American rock band Paramore, released on
                    July 26, 2005 under the Atlantic-distributed Fueled by Ramen in the United States. Its production
                    was led by James Paul Wisner, Mike Green, Nick
                    Trevisick, and Roger Alan Nichols. Josh Farro and Hayley Williams, guitarist and vocalist of
                    Paramore, respectively, wrote almost all the songs. The departure of bassist Jeremy Davis, which
                    occurred a few days after arriving in Orlando, served as the
                    album's main theme. This theme was reflected especially in the album's cover and title.
                    Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been
                    labeled a "scene classic".

The
                    album's production took place in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards
                    radio, the band's A&amp;R recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. The
                    album received mixed reviews by music journalism, who
                    praised the voice of Hayley Williams. However, the album had a weak domestic commercial performance:
                    it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboard's Heatseekers
                    Chart. The album reached No. 4 on the UK Rock
                    Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach the place fifty-one the UK Albums Chart and earned
                    certification as a gold record by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its
                    following records, All We Know Is Falling received gold
                    certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles from the
                    album were released: "Pressure", "Emergency" and "All We Know". None
                    of the singles managed to reach any major chart,
                    although "Pressure" was certified gold by the RIAA in 2016 after the band found commercial
                    success with subsequent releases. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/All+We+Know+Is+Falling"&gt;Read

In total, they have released five Top 40 Billboard
                Hot 100 hits, including the hit single
                "Misery Business", which was released as the lead single from Riot! and brought the band to
                prominence and earned the band their first Grammy nomination for "Best New Artist" in 2008.

In 2014, "Ain't
                It Fun" was released as the third and the last worldwide single from the self-titled album, which
                earned the band their highest peaking
                single as well as their first Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and their first #1 on Billboard
                Hot Rock Songs chart. Moreover, the song received crossover success, reaching #2 on Billboard Mainstream

                first Grammy award for "Best Rock Song" in 2015. At the end of 2015, it was reported Jeremy
                Davis (bass guitar) left the band.

In 2017, Zac Farro officially rejoined the band. &lt;a

				<content>Shawn Mendes (born Shawn Peter Raul Mendes; August 8, 1998 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a
                Canadian singer-songwriter. Since the release of his self-titled The Shawn Mendes EP and his debut
                single "Life of the Party", he has been
                gaining mainstream success as a singer-songwriter and touring artist.

Mendes was born in
                Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was raised in Pickering, a suburb of the city. He is the son of Karen, a
                real estate agent, and Manuel Mendes, a
                businessman. His father is of Portuguese descent (from a family from Lagos), while his mother is
                English. 

He first started posting cover videos on the popular social video app Vine in 2013
                and picked up millions of views and followers in a
                matter of months, becoming well known for his six-second snippets of renditions of many popular songs.
                Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records
                where he eventually signed and released his
                first single "Life of the Party" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top
                25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at
                15 years, 11 months and 4 days of
                age.

Prior to his signing, Mendes toured as a member of the MagCon Tour alongside other young
                artists and social media sensations such as Nash Grier, Cameron Dallas, Jack &amp; Jack, and more.
                Mendes was also on a nationwide tour with Austin
                Mahone as an opening act and released his debut major label EP in July, with a debut album due out later
                in 2014. He won the Teen Choice award in 2014 for Webstar in Music. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Shawn+Mendes"&gt;Read

					<summary>Blurryface (stylized as BLURRYFΛCE) is the fourth studio album by American duo twenty one
                    pilots. Originally set to be released on May 19, 2015 through Fueled by Ramen, the album was
                    released two days early by the band on May 17, 2015, via
                    iTunes. The album was preceded by its lead single, "Fairly Local", released on March 17,
                    2015.

The album is named after a character made by the band called Blurryface. According to
                    Joseph, he "represents all the things that I
                    as an individual, but also everyone around, is insecure about.". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots/Blurryface"&gt;Read

					<content>Blurryface (stylized as BLURRYFΛCE) is the fourth studio album by American duo twenty one
                    pilots. Originally set to be released on May 19, 2015 through Fueled by Ramen, the album was

                    2015.

The album is named after a character made by the band called Blurryface. According to
                    Joseph, he "represents all the things that I
                    as an individual, but also everyone around, is insecure about.".

Following the release
                    of their debut major label album Vessel (2013), the band toured extensively in support of the album
                    worldwide. On March 17, 2015, the band announced
                    the album's title, track listing, release date, and revealed the album's artwork. The band
                    released their new single "Fairly Local" on the same day accompanied by its music video
                    which premiered on official Fueled by Ramen YouTube
                    channel.

On April 6, the band released the second single of the album, "Tear in My
                    Heart", with an official music video released through YouTube. The third single, "Stressed
                    Out", was released on April 28 with a music
                    video. On May 4, 2015, the band posted a YouTube video streaming the audio of the album's 6th
                    track, "Lane Boy", and released "Ride" seven days later through the same media;
                    both were also singles on Google Play Store, being
                    released on the 4th and 12th, respectively. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots/Blurryface"&gt;Read

					<summary>Vessel is the third studio album from American duo Twenty One Pilots which was released on
                    January 8, 2013 through Fueled by Ramen. It is their first full-length release since being signed in
                    2012.

In a fan-based interview, lead
                    singer Tyler Joseph spoke on the meaning behind the album's name, saying that a vessel (our
                    body) is an object carrying something far more important than the outer shell, and when we die, that
                    is set free and lives on. &lt;a

				<content>Twenty One Pilots is a Grammy Award-winning American musical duo that originates from Columbus,
                Ohio. The band was formed in 2009 by Tyler Joseph along with former members Nick Thomas and Chris Salih,
                and currently consists of
                vocalist/keyboardist Tyler Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. They self-released two albums, Twenty One Pilots
                (2009) and Regional at Best (2011), before being signed by Fueled By Ramen in 2012. They released their
                signed debut, Vessel (2013) and second
                signed album, Blurryface (2015).

Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun have earned widespread acclaim for
                their energetic live sets and distinctive fusion of piano-driven pop and lyrical uplift. No strangers to
                the road, Twenty One Pilots have built a
                fervent national following via their electrifying live performances at innumerable headline shows and
                tours.

Joseph arrived at the band's name while studying the play All My Sons by Arthur
                Miller. The story centers around a World War II
                man who, for the good of his business and reputation, makes a tough decision to knowingly send out
                faulty airplane parts. 'twenty one pilots' died as a result. Tyler explains that this story of
                moral dilemma was the inspiration for the
                band's name. On December 29, 2009, Twenty One Pilots released their debut, self-titled album and
                began touring Ohio.

In mid-2011, bassist Nick Thomas and drummer Chris Salih sequentially left
                due to busy schedules, both posting farewell
                notes on the band's Facebook page. Joseph was then joined by Josh Dun, former live drummer of House
                of Heroes. On July 8, 2011, Joseph and Dun released a second independent album, Regional At Best.

Since
                signing to Fueled By Ramen in
                2012, the duo have released their major label debut Vessel in January of 2013, and its explosively
                popular follow-up Blurryface in May of 2015. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Twenty+One+Pilots"&gt;Read

					<content>Confessions is the fourth studio album by American R&amp;B and pop singer-songwriter Usher,
                    released March 23, 2004 on Arista Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 2003 to
                    2004 and featured production by Jermaine Dupri,
                    Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Lil Jon. Confessions showcases the vocals of Usher as a crooner. A R&amp;B-centered
                    album, it also encompasses musical genres such as hip hop and crunk. The album's themes
                    generated controversy about Usher's
                    personal relationship; however, the album's primary producer Jermaine Dupri claimed the record
                    reflects his personal story.

Confessions was an instant commercial success in the United
                    States, selling 1.1 million copies in its debut, the
                    most copies ever sold in a week by an R&amp;B recording artist. The album's continued success
                    was bolstered by its four chart-topping singles. As a strategy to boost its sales amid threats of
                    bootlegging, a special edition of the album was
                    issued featuring the hit single "My Boo". Although it received criticism for its lyrical
                    quality, Confessions received generally positive reviews and earned Usher several awards. In 2005,
                    the album won a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary
                    R&amp;B Album. The success of the album put Usher in the mainstream, becoming the biggest artist of
                    2004. Confessions has sold over 10 million copies in the United States, and has been certified
                    diamond in sales by the Recording Industry Association
                    of America (RIAA). The album has gone platinum and gold in over twenty other countries, and has sold
                    nearly 20 million copies worldwide.

Usher did not think of collaborating with many new
                    record producers to handle Confessions. With the
                    production started in 2003, he opted to continue creating music with Jermaine Dupri, who produced
                    his last two albums, My Way (1997) and 8701 (2001). In spite of his vision, Usher contacted a few
                    new producers as well: "With this album I choose
                    some new producers who I figured would definitely allow me to really articulate myself in a
                    different way ... Every album you gotta grow. You gotta look for something different." Dupri
                    also invited his frequent collaborator Bryan-Michael Cox.
                    The album features productions by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, The Neptunes, Just Blaze, R. Kelly, and
                    Usher's brother James Lackey.

With forty recorded songs, Usher felt the album had
                    already been completed. Initially, he submitted the
                    album to his record label, Arista. He and the company's then-president, L.A. Reid, listened to
                    the record; however, they thought something was missing in it: "You know what, there's
                    like one or two more records that we just gotta
                    get." Usher was displeased with the decision: He felt returning to the studio was the hardest
                    part and needed to re-motivated himself. He went on recording a few more tracks with help from
                    fellow Atlantians Lil Jon and Ludacris. Eventually, the
                    team was able to produce songs like "Red Light" and "Yeah!". He also recorded
                    songs with P. Diddy and The Neptunes during one of those sessions but were not released.

One
                    of Usher's first steps in making Confessions
                    was deciding to reveal "his own little secrets". Friend and former A&amp;R rep Kawan
                    "KP" Prather thought that it would let the public know Usher personally: "The music
                    has never been the question, but people tend to buy into
                    the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you."
                    Primarily because of its personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named
                    the album Confessions because he felt it is his
                    most personal record to date: "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our
                    closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of
                    things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go
                    of." He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.

Several of the
                    songs in the album were conceptually based from a situation. For instance, "Burn" was
                    built around a situation where Usher's two-year
                    relationship with Rozonda "Chilli" Thomas of American R&amp;B-hip hop girl group TLC was
                    about to end. Dupri and Cox were talking and felt that there is a song in it, and started writing.
                    Same through with the supposedly title track
                    "Confessions Part II"; they were conversing about an impregnated a mistress, and its
                    concept was written down. Usher was recording "Confessions Part II" on a July 2003 session
                    in New York City, United States. With Usher singing
                    the song's lyrics, the theme of cheating inspired him and Dupri; both decided to produce two
                    parts: "Confessions Part I" and "Confessions Part II (the former is heard at the
                    beginning of the video for the
                    latter).

Confessions is dominantly in the R&amp;B genre. Usher commented that he chose to
                    work with collaborators who know "... how to interpret R&amp;B from a jazz standpoint, an old
                    school throwback standpoint, a new school point, a
                    traditional classic standpoint ..." With producers and him set to produce such album, however,
                    other types of genres including hip hop are incorporated. While he wanted to do R&amp;B, Usher also
                    wanted his fans to experience hip hop and at the
                    same time R&amp;B: "I try to think outside the box." When Lil Jon came in the scene, crunk
                    was introduced to the R&amp;B-centered album, specifically on the song "Yeah!". Usher
                    said, "'Yeah!' could be called the
                    first consciously styled "crunk R&amp;B" record." The album also houses various slow
                    jams.

It also introduces a new style for Usher, focusing on his voice and technique. Andre
                    "Dre" Harris and Vidal Davis listened to
                    8701 and felt that "Usher really needs to sing hard and let people know his vocal ability".
                    With efforts focused on the record to demonstrate his vocal ability to listeners, songs such as
                    "Superstar" and "Follow Me"
                    exhibited Usher in a type of "crooner mode". The ballad-oriented "Burn" also
                    showcases his vocal aptitude.

With sales of more than eight million in 2004, Confessions is
                    named in the United States the most-shipped album of
                    the year. Along with the success of the American singer Norah Jones's second album, Feels like
                    Home (2004), as well as breakthroughs albums by many new and old artists, it was seen as a sign that
                    US record sales were slowly recovering after
                    three straight years of decline due to competing DVDs and video games and the prevalent music
                    piracy. By the end of 2004, the industry had sold 667 million albums, an increase of about 1.6
                    percent, as recorded by Nielsen SoundScan. Compared with
                    sales records in 2003, the figures showed eight percent increase.

The public speculated
                    that 2004 was the year of Usher. The success of the album put Usher in the mainstream, becoming the
                    biggest artist of 2004. Others also said that Usher
                    might be the successor of Michael Jackson. The success of the album had also facilitated Usher to
                    branch out to non-musical ventures. He has opened a restaurant, starred in a film, launched his
                    record label and recruited artists, and has done
                    philanthropic activities like his efforts in helping 2005 Hurricane Katrina victims. Usher was not
                    the only person who benefited from the album's significant critical and commercial success.
                    Bryan-Michael Cox, who co-wrote and co-produced
                    "Burn", earned credibility in the music industry for his role in the album. Cox had been
                    producing records for several notable American artists, including Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and
                    Destiny's Child, among others, but he
                    considered "Burn" as his crowning moment, which earned him two Grammy Award nominations.
                    With 2004 deemed to be his introduction to a larger, more mainstream audience, Cox stated in an
                    interview for MTV that many people were starting to
                    recount what he had done. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Usher/Confessions"&gt;Read

                    Bangladesh, and Tricky Stewart.

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200
                    chart, selling 329,000 copies in its first week. It sold over
                    one million copies in the United States and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry
                    Association of America (RIAA). The album also produced five singles that achieved chart success,
                    including US hits "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)",
                    "Lil Freak", "There Goes My Baby", and international hits "OMG" and
                    "More".

Upon its release, Raymond v. Raymond received generally mixed reviews
                    from music critics, who were ambivalent towards its
                    songwriting and themes. Nonetheless, the album earned Usher several awards, including Grammy Awards
                    for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album and Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Usher promoted the
                    album with a supporting international tour, OMG Tour,
                    in 2011. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Usher/Raymond+v+Raymond"&gt;Read more on

					<content>Achtung Baby is the seventh studio album by Irish rock band U2, released on 19 November 1991.
                    The album arrived nearly two years after lead vocalist Bono announced the band would have to "go
                    away and dream it all up again",
                    following the mixed response to 1988's Rattle and Hum. While recording Achtung Baby, there was
                    a rift between band members over the direction of the band's sound. Tensions almost prompted U2
                    to break-up until the band rallied around the
                    writing of the album's hit One.

The album marks a dramatic change in the band's
                    image and sound, with the band being heavily influenced by alternative rock and electronic music.
                    Their music also features more detailed production,
                    more guitar effects, and darker, more personal lyrical content. The results were considerably more
                    adventurous than their previous efforts, yet Achtung Baby was very commercially and critically
                    successful, winning a Grammy Award and having sold
                    approximately 18 million copies worldwide. In 2003, the album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone
                    magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.

The band embarked on the
                    elaborately-staged, multimedia-intensive Zoo TV Tour to
                    support the album.

History
Achtung Baby was a departure for the band. Bono has often
                    described the album as "the sound of four men trying to chop down The Joshua Tree". U2
                    sampled techniques and sounds from other musical genres
                    previously unused by the band, including dance, house and electronica, whilst maintaining their
                    original feel of rock and roll.

The album's new sound was a source of conflict in the
                    band because The Edge and Bono favored the new sounds
                    they were coming up with while recording their sessions in Berlin, while drummer Larry Mullen Jr.
                    and bassist Adam Clayton were partial to the band's traditional sound. The conflict amongst the
                    members of U2 very nearly led to the band breaking
                    up, but the fighting subdued after The Edge, struggling with two bridge sections for the song
                    Ultraviolet (Light My Way) was encouraged to combine them by the band and producers Brian Eno and
                    Daniel Lanois. The band rallied around the riff and was
                    inspired to write the song One. It changed the band's outlook on the album, helping bring them
                    back from the brink during recording sessions. One was responsible for a renewed sense of optimism
                    towards the material they had already recorded.
                    Leaving Berlin on a high note, the band was able to complete the rest of the album in Dublin.

Achtung
                    Baby was also darker sounding than previous efforts, thanks in large part to songs such as The Fly,
                    Acrobat, and Love Is Blindness, which
                    deal with themes of helplessness, broken relationships, and (in the case of Love Is Blindness)
                    violence in the name of love. The spiritual yearning of U2's 1980s work began to take on a more
                    existential, despairing element in Achtung Baby. The
                    band's political activism moved to the AIDS crisis and environmental issues. At the same time,
                    the band also took on a lighter tone, electing to use irony rather than earnestness in its music and
                    public appearances, and poking fun at its own
                    self-importance during the 1980s. This evolving outlook culminated in the pleaful soul-searching
                    (and jaded skewering of contemporary life) on 1997's Pop and would not subside until the more
                    hopeful tracks on 2000's All That You Can't
                    Leave Behind.

Other tracks included the distorted opener Zoo Station, the danceable single
                    Even Better Than The Real Thing, and the thumping rocker (and future live favourite) Until the End
                    of the World, written for the soundtrack of Wim
                    Wenders' eponymous 1991 science fiction film. The song may be an allegorical afterlife
                    confession of Judas Iscariot.

Achtung Baby expanded the group's fanbase. New fans were
                    perhaps drawn in by the hit song Mysterious Ways and the
                    ballad One.

The album was followed by the Zoo TV Tour, a ground-breaking and, in Zoo TV:
                    Live from Sydney, Grammy-award winning multimedia concert production.

The U.S. LP is the
                    only American release to contain the uncensored
                    picture of bassist Adam Clayton naked. On the U.S. CD and cassette, his private parts are censored
                    with a black "X" or a four-leaf clover.

As for the album's title, "Achtung,
                    Baby!" in German means "Attention,
                    baby!" or "Careful, baby!" Frequently used by the band's engineers during the
                    making of the album, the phrase came from the Mel Brooks film The Producers.

Achtung Baby
                    was the first of 9 albums to feature 3 songs to reach
                    the top of the Modern Rock Tracks.

Reception
On the Billboard Music Charts (North
                    America), Achtung Baby topped the Billboard 200 chart selling 295,000 copies in its first week. It
                    won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or
                    Group with Vocal. Rolling Stone magazine declared that U2 had "proven that the same penchant
                    for epic musical and verbal gestures that leads many artists to self-parody can, in more inspired
                    hands, fuel the unforgettable fire that defines great
                    rock &amp; roll."

The album is frequently cited as one of the greatest in rock
                    history. In 1998 Q magazine readers voted Achtung Baby the 15th greatest album of all time; in 2001
                    the TV network VH1 placed it at number 65. Also in 2003,
                    Q declared its third track, One, "the greatest recorded song of all time". In 2003, the
                    album was ranked number 62 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all
                    time. It was voted #11 on Spin's "Best
                    Albums of the Last 25 Years" list. In a 2007 VH1 countdown, One was named the #2 on its list of
                    "Songs of the 1990s". Entertainment Weekly named Achtung Baby the #3 album of the last 25
                    years.

Studio bootlegs

U2
                    entered the studio in late 1990 and began recording the album before they had written any material,
                    mainly improvising and developing ideas into songs. The more interesting ideas were preserved on
                    working tapes. In April 1991, these tapes fell into
                    the hands of bootleggers, well before the album's November release date. The most widely
                    circulated compilation of these tapes is the three-disc Salomé: The Axtung Beibi Outtakes, released
                    in February 1992. Another bootleg surfaced, entitled,
                    The Achtung Sessions in 1993.

Later that same year, another single disc bootleg of the
                    tapes was distributed underground. Called [album artist=U2[Studio Session '91, this single disc
                    contained material of songs that were near
                    completion. Most notably; Heaven and Hell, The Darkest Night, and Blow Your House Down.
                    Interestingly, none of the "Salome" mixes were included on this disc.

Since these
                    songs were leaked very early in the production process, they
                    provide a rare insight into the band's songwriting process. On the same note, many of the
                    ideas—including eight different takes of the song "Salomé"—were frustratingly undeveloped,
                    so the bootleg remains a curiosity strictly for
                    hardcore fans. Bono says, "There were no undiscovered works of genius, unfortunately, it was
                    more just gobbledy-gook."

Some of the ideas were revisited—there are, for instance,
                    early instrumental versions of Even Better Than the
                    Real Thing and North and South of the River (the latter of which wouldn't be recorded by the
                    band until 1997)—and one song—the B-side Where Did It All Go Wrong?—was even officially released as
                    a rough composite of the two takes available on the
                    bootleg. There are also a handful of developed ideas that were wholly abandoned, such as She's
                    Gonna Blow Your House Down, a song the group had been working on since the Rattle and Hum days.

Video
Following
                    the successful release of
                    the album, U2 released Achtung Baby: The Videos, The Cameos, and a Whole Lot of Interference from
                    Zoo TV, a VHS compilation of music videos from the album. The compilation featured nine videos,
                    including three videos for both One and Even Better than
                    the Real Thing. In between the videos were clips of "interference" — documentary footage,
                    media clips, and other images, similar to what was shown at shows during the Zoo TV Tour. The videos
                    for Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses and
                    Love Is Blindness were the only videos from the album not included on this release, as they were not
                    released until after the compilation's release.

                    number of occasions that they were "reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world".
                    U2 brought back producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois who had produced a number of the band's
                    previous albums.

All That You
                    Can't Leave Behind has sold over 12 million copies, received wide critical acclaim, and won
                    seven Grammy Awards. The songs "Beautiful Day", "Walk On", "Elevation",
                    and "Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out
                    Of" were all successful singles. In 2003, the album was ranked number 139 on Rolling Stone
                    magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". &lt;a

					<content>How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is the eleventh studio album by Irish rock band U2, released in
                    November 2004. Much like their previous album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, How to
                    Dismantle an Atomic Bomb was commercially successful
                    and critically acclaimed and maintains a more traditional rock sound after the band experimented
                    with alternative rock and dance music in the 1990s. The album was produced by Steve Lillywhite, with
                    others involved in the production including Flood,
                    Jacknife Lee, Nellee Hooper, Chris Thomas, Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Carl Glanville. The title
                    of the album derives from a lyric in the song "Fast Cars", which was only available on
                    some versions of the album.

U2 lead singer
                    Bono described the album as "our first rock album. It's taken us twenty years or whatever
                    it is, but this is our first rock album." [1] Although not a concept album in the traditional
                    sense, most of the music on the record deals with
                    the world at the crossroads of its existence. Love and war, peace and harmony, and approaching death
                    are themes of the album.

How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and its singles won all nine
                    Grammy Awards for which it was nominated (U2
                    themselves were awarded eight out of the nine). The album also was the fourth biggest selling album
                    of 2004 [2], selling over 9 million copies[3] and yielded several successful singles in "Vertigo",
                    "City of Blinding Lights", and
                    "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own". &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/U2/How+to+Dismantle+an+Atomic+Bomb"&gt;Read

					<content>The Joshua Tree is the fifth studio album by Irish rock band U2, released March 9, 1987 on
                    Island Records. Recording sessions took place from July to November of 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios
                    in Dublin. The album features the band's
                    exploration of roots rock, with their music exhibiting influences from blues-rock, folk rock,
                    Southern rock, and gospel music. Lyrically, The Joshua Tree depicts the band's fascination with
                    America and many of the ideas it stands for. The album
                    was produced and engineered by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.

The album increased the band's
                    stature "from heroes to superstars," according to Rolling Stone. The album produced
                    several hit singles, including "Where the
                    Streets Have No Name", "With or Without You", and "I Still Haven't Found
                    What I'm Looking For", all of which remain radio staples. The Joshua Tree won Grammy
                    Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with
                    Vocal and Album of the Year in Grammy Awards of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 26 on
                    Rolling Stone magazine's list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The album is
                    one of the world's best-selling albums of
                    all-time, having sold over 28 million copies. In 2007, a remastered version of the album was
                    released to mark the 20th anniversary of its original release.

Following The Unforgettable
                    Fire album, U2 realised that they "had no tradition,
                    we were from outer space", and they explored American blues, country and gospel music. Since
                    that album, they had spent time with fellow Irish bands The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, and felt
                    a sense of indigenous Irish music being blended
                    with American folk music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Keith Richards encouraged the
                    band to look back to the roots of rock music, and focused Bono on his skills as a song and lyric
                    writer. The band wanted to build on The
                    Unforgettable Fire's atmospherics, but also sought a more hard-hitting sound within the strict
                    discipline of more conventional song structures, in contrast to The Unforgettable Fire's often
                    out-of-focus experimentation.

The band
                    interrupted their 1986 album sessions to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope
                    Tour. Rather than being a distraction, the band found the tour added extra intensity and power to
                    their new music, providing extra focus on what they
                    wanted to say. The album sessions for The Joshua Tree proper began in July 1986 at Windmill Lane
                    Studios in Dublin.

In his earlier 1986 travels to Central America, Bono saw first hand the
                    distress of peasants bullied in political conflicts,
                    and this was a central influence on the album. The United States' military intervention in El
                    Salvador angered Bono and prompted him to ask The Edge to "put El Salvador through an amplifier"
                    for the song "Bullet the Blue
                    Sky". "Mothers of the Disappeared" was inspired by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo,
                    the mothers of the thousands of "disappeared" people who opposed the Videla and Galtieri
                    coup d'état that overtook Argentina in 1976,
                    and who were kidnapped and never seen again.

The album juxtaposes antipathy towards the
                    United States, including anger at United States foreign policy in Central America, against the band's
                    deep fascination with the country, its open
                    spaces, freedom and what it stood for. The band wanted music with a sense of location, a 'cinematic'
                    quality; its music and lyrics drew on imagery created by American writers the band had been reading.
                    The band had toured in the United
                    States extensively, which affected the band; according to Bono, the album was inspired and
                    influenced more by the country's geography, rather than its people. Bono said he "...had
                    to 'deal with' the United States and the way it
                    was affecting me, because the United States' having such an effect on the world at the moment.
                    On this record I had to deal with it on a political level for the first time, if in a subtle way."
                    Since Bono was trying to portray the both
                    "mythic idea of America" and the "reality of America" on the album, the working
                    title of the album was "The Two Americas".

The record was also influenced by the
                    blues. While in recording sessions for the b-side
                    "Silver and Gold", working with Keith Richards, Bono and Richards listened to blues music,
                    country music, American pop music from the 1950s, and other such influences. These influences,
                    combined with Bono's early influences, such as
                    Patti Smith and Bob Dylan, had an effect on the song and the whole album.

"Where the
                    Streets Have No Name" was conceived prior to one of the Joshua Tree recording sessions by
                    guitarist The Edge. Bono conceived the lyrics with the
                    idea that one could determine a person's religion and income based on where they lived in
                    Belfast. While recording the song as a band, however, U2 ran into difficulty. The song's
                    frequent chord and time changes caused problems in playing
                    the song correctly; the difficulty was so great that producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the
                    track. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, "It took so long to get that song
                    right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It
                    only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half
                    the song it is live."

"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"
                    grew from another song called "Under the
                    Weather Girls", which co-producer Daniel Lanois didn't like, except for Larry Mullen, Jr.'s
                    drum track and Adam Clayton's bass line. These parts were used as the foundation of "I
                    Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking
                    For". The development of the song saw the addition of such things as a subtle auto-pan effect
                    added to one of The Edge's guitar overdubs and Bono, a tenor, singing in the upper register of
                    his range to add to the feeling of spiritual
                    yearning. Both Bono and Edge have, in fact, called it a gospel song on numerous occasions.

"With
                    or Without You", the album's first single and one of the band's most well-known
                    songs, uses an effect called "infinite
                    guitar", developed by Michael Brook, to infinitely sustain notes.

The band concluded
                    recording of the album in November 1986.

A number of songs that were released as B-sides to
                    singles from The Joshua Tree are thought to have
                    been considered for a double-album version of The Joshua Tree. Though Bono was the most vocal
                    proponent of this extended version of the album, The Edge successfully argued for the 11-track
                    version that was ultimately released.[citation needed]
                    "Spanish Eyes" and "Deep in the Heart" were released as B-sides to the "I
                    Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" single. "Luminous Times (Hold on to
                    Love)" and "Walk to the Water" were
                    released as B-sides to the "With or Without You" single. "Sweetest Thing",
                    "Silver and Gold", and "Race Against Time" were released as B-sides to the
                    "Where the Streets Have No Name"
                    single.

The Joshua Tree was first released on 9 March 1987. The album cover photo was taken
                    by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn in December 1986. Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in
                    Death Valley, California; "This is the most
                    serious set of shots I have taken of U2 and they became my most well-known photographs at the time.
                    It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of
                    the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in
                    America."

In 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring
                    remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Four different formats of the remaster were made
                    available.

"With or Without You"
                    and the rhythmic gospel "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" were
                    released as singles internationally and quickly went to #1 in the U.S. "Where the Streets Have
                    No Name" was also successfully released. "In
                    God's Country" was released as a fourth single in North America with modest success, while
                    "One Tree Hill" was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand. Initially
                    slated as a single release, "Red Hill Mining
                    Town" was the only track from the album not played on the tour. Bono has suggested that the
                    song's high notes put too much strain on his voice.

Upon its release, The Joshua Tree
                    debuted at #1 in the UK and also quickly reached the
                    top of the charts in the U.S. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time
                    magazine (following The Beatles, The Band, and The Who), who declared that U2 was "Rock's
                    Hottest Ticket". The album brought U2 to a new
                    level of mega-stardom, as the worldwide Joshua Tree Tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the
                    world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size.

The Joshua Tree
                    won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, with the band
                    receiving honors for "Album of the Year" and "Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group
                    With Vocal".

According to U.S. Recording Industry sales figures, as of January 2005,
                    The Joshua Tree ranks as the 89th best-selling
                    album of all-time in the U.S. and, as of 2006, the 26th best-selling album in the U.K.. The album
                    has sold 10 million copies in the United States alone and more than 25 million copies worldwide. It
                    remains the band's best-selling
                    album.

The Joshua Tree is often cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In
                    1989, it was rated #3 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of "The 100 Greatest Albums of the
                    80's", as well as appearing at #26 on the
                    magazine's "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". The Definitive 200 list sponsored by
                    the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ranks the album as the fifth-greatest in history. The Joshua Tree was
                    selected as #6 on CCM Magazine's 2001 list of
                    the greatest Contemporary Christian music albums of all time (see CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest
                    Albums in Christian Music). It came second place in Channel 4's 100 Greatest albums. It came in
                    at #10 on ABC Television's My Favourite Album
                    program, which aired in Australia in December 2006. &lt;a href="http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree"&gt;Read

				<content>U2 is an alternative rock band from Ireland which formed in 1976 in Dublin, Ireland. Since the
                band’s formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The
                Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar,
                keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is
                the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of
                2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were
                inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58
                singles.

Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in
                his school asking for musicians to form a
                rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists,
                including The Edge’s brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter
                Martin. According to legend, Bono originally
                auditioned as a guitarist but couldn’t play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn’t sing. He
                was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was
                strangely able to reach the audience when the
                band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess
                with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon
                leave the band and the group would go
                through the names “Feedback ” and “The Hype” before finally settling on U2.

The 70s &amp; 80s:
                1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest
                in 1978: £500 and funds to make a record.
                Paul McGuinness became the band’s manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day,
                the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed
                albums incl.: October, War, Under A Blood Red
                Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by
                many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called “a different kind” of band.
                After a short break U2 returned with The
                Joshua Tree &amp; the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the
                tour).

The 90s: Promising ”to dream it all up again”, they added industrial and dance styles to
                their music. Trying to drop a goody two
                shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they
                started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning ”watch
                out, baby”, artwork feat. make-up artist
                Nassim Khalifa) &amp; Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as “The Fly”, “Mirrorball Man” and
                “Mr. MacPhisto” for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all
                its extremes with the album Pop and
                consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden
                arch across the stage.

The 00s: At the end of the 90’s into 00’s U2 became less image and more
                reality. With the death of Bono’s good
                friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding
                ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say
                they’ve returned to a more band-centric sound
                with albums like All That You Can’t Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono’s father
                who passed away shortly after the album’s conception and 2004’s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.

The
                10s: U2 went on the U2 360° Tour in
                2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently
                working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse.

The Name: There are many theories as to
                the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was
                an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious
                candidates include “You too” and “You two”, etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name’s origins
                remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying
                that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons… U2

                    was not released until 1977 and peaked at #92. Moondance was critically acclaimed when first
                    released and established Morrison as a major artist. The
                    songs on the album quickly became staples of FM radio. It has proven to be Morrison's most
                    famous album, often appearing on many lists of best albums of all time. Among other awards, it was
                    inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. &lt;a

				<content>Sir George Ivan "Van" Morrison, OBE (generally known as Van Morrison) (born 31 August
                1945) is a Grammy Award-winning artist from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He's a singer, songwriter,
                author, poet, and multi-instrumentalist,
                who has been a professional musician since 1958. He plays a variety of instruments, including the
                guitar, harmonica, keyboards, drums, and saxophone. Featuring his characteristic growl - a unique mix of
                folk, blues, Irish, scat, and Celtic influences
                - Morrison is widely considered one of the most unusual and influential vocalists in the history of rock
                and roll. He has received numerous music awards during his career, including six Grammy Awards
                (1996–2007); inductions into the Rock and Roll
                Hall of Fame (January 1993), the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and the Irish Music Hall of Fame
                (September 1999); and a Brit Award (February 1994).

Known as "Van the Man" by his
                fans, Morrison first rose to prominence as
                the lead singer of the Northern Irish band Them, writing their 1964 hit "Gloria". A few years
                later, Morrison left the band for a successful solo career, starting with the album Astral Weeks.

Morrison
                has pursued an idiosyncratic
                musical path. Much of his music is tightly structured around the conventions of American soul and R&amp;B,
                such as the popular singles "Brown Eyed Girl", "Moondance", "Domino", and
                "Wild Night". An equal part
                of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show
                the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as his classic
                album Astral Weeks and lesser known works
                such as Veedon Fleece and Common One. The two strains together are sometimes referred to as "Celtic
                Soul," and Morrison rejects the characterization of his genre of music as Rock, citing Elvis
                Presley as a non-influence.

He
                continues to perform regularly, and achieved his highest U.S. chart position (number ten on the
                Billboard 200) with his 2008 album, Keep It Simple. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Van+Morrison"&gt;Read

					<summary>Pinkerton is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Weezer, released on

				<content>Weezer is an American rock band. Formed in 1992, they have released eight full length albums, six
                EPs, and a DVD. Their latest album, titled 'Weezer (White Album)', came out on April 1st,
                2016. They've sold over nine million
                records in the United States to date. Playing music influenced by alternative bands and power pop
                artists among others, they're sometimes viewed as a part of the 90s indie movement.

Weezer
                started in Los Angeles, California when Rivers
                Cuomo joined with Patrick Wilson, Matt Sharp, and Jason Cropper, who was later replaced by Brian Bell.
                Five weeks after forming, they had their first gig, opening for Dogstar at Raji's Bar and Ribshack
                on Hollywood Boulevard. Weezer began
                playing clubs to small audiences around L.A. and recording homemade demos. The group soon received
                attention from various A&amp;R reps, and the guys were signed on June 26, 1993 by Todd Sullivan, an A&amp;R
                rep from Geffen Records. The band became a
                part of the DGC label (which later turned into Interscope).

Creating "The Blue Album"
                (1993-1994)

The self-titled debut, 'Weezer', commonly referred to as 'The Blue
                Album', came out on May 10, 1994. It
                picked up considerable acclaim. Tracks "Undone (The Sweater Song)" (also known as "Undone
                - The Sweater Song"), "Buddy Holly", and "Say It Ain't So” were released as
                singles. The album was produced by former
                The Cars frontman Ric Ocasek. During the recording of the Blue Album, Jason Cropper left the band to
                take care of his future wife, who was pregnant with their first child. Jason was replaced by Brian Bell,
                a then bassist from a band called Carnival
                Art.

The first single, "Undone - The Sweater Song", garnered attention given that
                Spike Jonze directed the music video for the track. In a single, unbroken take, that video featured
                Weezer performing the song on a sound stage with
                various amusing studio antics, including a pack of dogs swarming the set. Jonze also later directed the
                band's second video, which was made for the single "Buddy Holly".

Named after
                the famous 50s rock star, the "Buddy
                Holly" music video featured footage of the television sitcom Happy Days spliced with the band
                performing in a remade "Arnold's Diner", a setting from the series. The video had heavy
                rotation on MTV. It went on to win Jonze and the
                band four MTV Video Music Awards (including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video) and two
                Billboard Music Video Awards. This video was also included as a bonus on the Microsoft Windows 95 CD.
                The success of the video arguably served as
                the key for pushing the band into the mainstream rock spotlight.

The video for Weezer's
                third single, "Say It Ain't So", was directed by Sophie Muller. It featured the bandmates
                playing hacky-sack and performing in the
                band's original rehearsal space in California. A photo of what the band calls the "Garage"
                is featured on the inside cover of the album.

'The Blue Album' is currently certified
                three times platinum, making it
                Weezer's all-time best seller and one of the most popular rock albums of the early 90s. It was
                re-released and repackaged in 2004 as a "Deluxe Edition". That version of the album included a
                second disc of B-sides along with other
                previously unreleased rarities.

Killer Record: Pinkerton(1995-1997)

In late December
                1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled back east to his home
                state of Connecticut. Using an eight-track
                recorder, he began piecing together demo material for Weezer's next album. Cuomo's original
                concept for Weezer's sophomore effort was to be a space-themed rock opera, with him mulling over
                the title 'Songs from the Black
                Hole'.

The album was intended to feature songs that flowed together seamlessly, and it was
                planned to end with a special coda that briefly revisited the major musical elements of the piece
                (something reminiscent of progressive rock
                works from the 70s). The band began demoing and working on Cuomo's concept through intermittent
                recording sessions in the spring and summer of 1995. Ultimately, the 'Songs from the Black Hole'
                album concept was dropped. The album that
                actually came out would instead feature some old tunes made from before their first album (which had
                briefly been incorporated into the space-opera) as well as some new ones written while Cuomo was at
                Harvard.

After the multi-platinum
                success of their debut album, Weezer's sophomore album was finally released on September 24, 1996.
                Titled 'Pinkerton', the work peaked at #19 in the U.S. upon its release. It didn't sell
                as many copies as its predecessor, probably
                due to its darker, more abrasive nature. Pinkerton was labeled "one of the worst albums of 1996"
                by a Rolling Stone reader poll. Eventually, the album grew into a cult classic, and is viewed by some
                fans as Weezer's greatest album. In
                fact, in 2004, the magazine changed their rating to a 5-star rating and inducted it into The Rolling
                Stone Hall Of Fame. This article can be found in the Reviews sections of the 500 Greatest Songs Of All
                Time issue.

Three singles were taken
                from the album: "El Scorcho", "The Good Life" and "Pink Triangle". The
                video for "El Scorcho" featured the band inside a darkened room, sitting in a circle, that
                would be lit differently throughout parts of the
                song; it was directed by Mark Romanek. The video for "The Good Life" was directed by the team
                of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris (though no known video was made for "Pink Triangle").
                However, the singles did not receive as much
                airtime as the singles from their debut album.

The title of the album comes from the character
                Lieutenant Pinkerton in Giacomo Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly. The entire album is heavily
                influenced by the opera's story line.
                Madame Butterfly is mentioned under her real name, Cio-Cio San, in "El Scorcho." The song
                "Butterfly" is written from Pinkerton's point of view at the end of the opera.

The
                album's title was the source of a
                legal challenge. Pinkerton Securities of Encino, Calif., filed a temporary restraining order against the
                band and its Geffen record label for copyright infringement two days before the album was to be released
                on September 24, 1996. A judge ruled
                against the security company and the album was finally released.

Weezer completed their touring
                for Pinkerton in the summer of 1997. The members of the band took a break, with drummer Patrick Wilson
                returning to his home in Portland, Oregon
                to work on his side project, The Special Goodness, Matt Sharp left to complete the follow-up album for
                his group The Rentals, and Brian Bell went to work on his group, Space Twins.

Rivers Cuomo
                returned to Boston, Massachusetts, but dropped
                out of Harvard to focus on songwriting. He eventually went into seclusion. He painted his walls black,
                disconnected his phone, and didn't communicate with anyone. Later, he formed a solo group, The
                Rivers Cuomo Band. Cuomo used the group to try
                out unreleased material, including possible new songs for the next Weezer album. The band played their
                first show at T.T. the Bear's on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was part of the
                solo band's lineup. The Boston songs
                were later abandoned and not used on the next Weezer album, but live recordings of the Boston shows are
                openly traded on the internet. In February of 1998, Rivers left Boston and Harvard academia behind and
                returned to Los Angeles.

Pat
                Wilson and Brian Bell joined Cuomo in L.A. to start work on the next album. Matt Sharp did not rejoin
                the band and officially left the group in April of 1998. The group decided on Mikey Welsh as Sharp's
                replacement. Weezer continued rehearsal
                and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in
                rehearsals, and in late fall of 1998, drummer Pat Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed
                productivity from Cuomo.

The band would
                not reunite until April of 2000, when the Fuji Festival in Japan offered Weezer a high-paying gig to
                play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer's productivity, and from April to
                May, 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new
                songs in Los Angeles. The band returned to live shows in June 2000, but without the Weezer name. Instead
                the shows featured the group's first use of the pseudonym Goat Punishment.

On June 23,
                2000, the band, now back under the Weezer
                name, joined the Warped Tour for eight planned dates. Weezer was received well at the festival, leading
                the band to book more tour dates for the summer.

SS2K - The Summer Sessions (2000)

In
                the summer of 2000, Weezer (now consisting
                of Rivers Cuomo, Mikey Welsh, Pat Wilson, and Brian Bell) went on tour. Weezer's setlist consisted
                of 14 new songs that fans have labeled the Summer Songs of 2000 (commonly abbreviated, SS2K). When 13 of
                these songs did not appear on
                Weezer's next album, fans of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio demos.
                Eventually, mp3s were made available on the band's official website for download. Three SS2K songs,
                "Hash Pipe", "Dope
                Nose" and "Slob," have appeared on studio albums ("Hash Pipe" on the Green
                Album and "Dope Nose" and "Slob" appearing on Maladroit).

Green Album &amp;
                Maladroit (2001-2003)

Eventually,
                the band went back into the studio to produce a third album. Weezer (2001) chose to repeat the
                self-titled name of their first release. This album quickly became known as The Green Album due to its
                distinctive bright green coloring. Shortly after the
                release of The Green Album, Weezer went on another American tour. They attracted a new generation of
                fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos of their hit singles "Hash Pipe" and "Island
                in the Sun."

The video for
                "Hash Pipe," directed by Marcos Siega featured sumo wrestlers and was nominated for Best Rock
                Video at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost out to Limp Bizkit's "Rollin." Two
                videos were recorded for "Island in the
                Sun." Marcos Siega directed the first, which focused on a Mexican wedding, and Spike Jonze directed
                the second, which involved Weezer with animals in a wildlife reserve. Their video for "Photograph"
                was shot and put together by Weezer
                friend and unofficial "5th member" Karl Koch.

As reported on August 16th, 2001, by
                MTV, bassist Mikey Welsh was checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously
                unknown, as he mysteriously went missing before
                their second filming of the "Island in the Sun" music video, featuring the band with various
                animals. Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo
                received Scott Shriner's number and
                asked if he was interested to fill in for Welsh. Shriner, at first believing it was a prank phone call,
                accepted.

Much to the ire of their recording label, Weezer decided to forgo the
                industry-preferred waiting period of 2 to 3 years between
                albums and began recording demos for their fourth album. The band took an experimental approach for the
                recording process by allowing fans to download the demos from their official website in return for
                feedback. After the release of the album, the
                band subsequently stated that the process was somewhat of a failure, as the fans did not supply them
                with cohesive constructive advice. Only the song "Slob" was included on the album due to
                general fan advice.

The fourth album,
                Maladroit, was released in 2002 with Scott Shriner replacing Mikey Welsh on the bass. The album served
                as a harder-edged version of their trademark catchy pop-influenced music. Although met with generally
                positive critical reviews (including making
                many "Best of '02" lists), its sales were not as strong as The Green Album and remains
                their worst-selling album to date.

Two singles were released from the album. The "Dope
                Nose" music video featured a Japanese
                motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for "Keep Fishin'"
                combined Weezer with The Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos
                Siega.

As soon as Maladroit had
                wrapped up, the band immediately began work on their fifth album, recording numerous demos between tours
                for Maladroit (often recording as many as 24 songs in a day). These songs were eventually scrapped, and
                Weezer took a break after the release of
                two albums in quick succession.

Make Believe (2003-2005)

In March of 2004, Weezer
                released their first DVD. Titled Video Capture Device, the DVD contains all of their then-current music
                videos. It also included live concerts and
                homemade movies. The DVD was certified "gold" on November 8, 2004.

From December 2003
                to the summer and early fall of 2004, the members of Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended
                for a new album to be released in the
                spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the
                public through the band's website. The demos, entitled the Album Five Demos (or album 4.5), were a
                big hit with fans but only one song,
                "Hold Me", would be included on the finished album. That album, entitled Make Believe, was
                released on May 10, 2005. The album was very well received by the public. However, long-time Weezer fans
                often consider it as a decline from their
                earlier albums, and has received mixed reviews.

The album's first single, "Beverly
                Hills," became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its
                release. The video for "Beverly
                Hills", directed by Marcos Siega, featured the band and a select choice of fans interacting with
                Playboy Bunnies and Hugh Hefner at the Playboy Mansion. It became the first Weezer song to hit #1 on the
                Billboard Modern Rock chart. The song was
                nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the
                band. The video for the song was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards.

During
                the "Make
                Believe" tour of 2005, Cuomo allowed other members of the band to step into the spotlight of
                certain songs:

 * Brian Bell: "Getchoo" and "Why Bother?" (from Pinkerton),
                "Smile" (from "The Green
                Album"), and "Keep Fishin'" (from Maladroit)
 * Scott Shriner: "Fall
                Together", and "Dope Nose", and "In the Garage" (from "The Blue Album")

                * Patrick Wilson: "Photograph"
                (from "The Green Album"), "Song 2" (Blur cover, whilst playing lead guitar)

In
                late August 2005, Weezer performed with the rock band The Pixies, which was one of Rivers'
                influences, at Summerfest and other
                dates.

From September 8 to October 28, 2005, Weezer set out on a tour with the Foo Fighters,
                which, to many, was simply called Foozer. The Foozer tour was awarded "Most Creative Tour Package"
                at The 17th Annual Concert Industry
                Awards.

On December 13th, 2005, Winter Weezerland EP was released on iTunes. The EP was
                essentially a re-release of the 2000 Weezer christmas CD which featured "The Christmas Song"
                and "Christmas
                Celebration".

Also, in late 2005 the band released the second single off Make Believe,
                called "We Are All on Drugs" (for family-oriented purposes, some releases of the song were
                renamed "We Are All in Love"), and the
                music video was directed by Justin Francis. It didn't do well as a single, and many weezer fans
                hated it.

In early 2006, it was announced that Make Believe was certified platinum, and "Beverly
                Hills" was the second most
                popular download on iTunes for 2005.

Also in early 2006, Make Believe's third single,
                "Perfect Situation", spent four weeks in a row at the #1 spot on the Billboard Modern Rock
                chart, a personal record for Weezer. The Perfect
                Situation video starred Elisha Cuthbert and was directed by Marc Webb. The only other Weezer track to
                hit #1 was "Beverly Hills," for one week. "This is Such a Pity" is the band's
                fourth single from the album, but no music
                video was made for its release.

The Future (2006-)

As of January, 2006, Bell and
                Wilson are set to portray Velvet Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale in Factory Girl, an upcoming
                film about the life of Andy Warhol cohort Edie
                Sedgwick.

Rivers Cuomo announced a new song called "Piece of the Pie" while onstage
                during the band's October 7th, 2005 show in Detroit (but did not perform it). Cuomo has mentioned
                other song ideas recently, dropping titles
                and ideas such as "East Coast or West Coast," "Pig" and new songs with lyrics he
                described as "bloggy".

Rivers has commented on his myspace blog that his recent
                comments to mtv.com were 'misquoted' and
                said that what he meant "was that the soccer song, "Our Time will Come", certainly won't
                be on a Weezer album." and said "The rest of the songs, though, are definite contenders for a
                Weezer record." A strong hint
                that the band are in fact only on a break and that a sixth album is on the card.

In late 2006,
                Brian Bell began work on a new project called The Relationship which fans can follow on the band's
                myspace page. Pat Wilson told Keifer Wells
                and Martin Michalek in a radio interview for Andover High School that he and Scott Shriner had been
                creating songs together and are trying to get Rivers to sing for when the band has jam sessions. Pat has
                also been creating a few Special Goodness
                songs, but said little more on the subject. Fans can currently follow the news of the band at Rivers
                Cuomo's myspace page and the official Weezer website.

Weezer's sixth studio album
                will be released on June 3, 2008, just over
                three years after their latest release, Make Believe. Rick Rubin produced the album[30] and Rich Costey
                provided the mixing[31] for what Weezer fans are calling "Album Six".[32] The record is being
                described as "experimental", and
                according to Cuomo, includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers,
                Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching
                instruments.[33]

Lead singer Rivers
                Cuomo released a demo-compilation album entitled Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo on December
                18, 2007. The album contains demos of Cuomo's that span from 1992 to 2007, including songs from
                Weezer's abandoned second album, Songs
                from the Black Hole. Also included in Alone is a song intended for Weezer's upcoming 6th studio
                album, entitled "This is the Way". The booklet of Alone tells of the band wanting the song for
                the album, but ultimately choosing "an
                epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song" entitled "Daydreamer" instead.

Weezer's
                "Weezer" (also referred to as "The Red Album") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin
                produced the album and Rich
                Costey mixed it. The record is being described as "experimental", and according to Cuomo,
                includes longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque
                counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo
                writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said that the album cost about a million dollars
                to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of "The Blue Album". The album's singles
                were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead
                single, "Pork and Beans", topped the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its
                music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The album's second single, "Troublemaker",
                debuted at #39 on the
                Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at #2. In October 2008, the group announced that the
                third single would be "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)".

In
                2009, the band announced their next
                album, "Raditude", would be released on November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh
                best-selling album of the week on the Billboard 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December
                2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with
                the new album's release. On December 6, 2009, Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo was injured when his
                tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his
                assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter,
                and their nanny were also on the bus; however, they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the
                following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.

In December 2009, it was revealed
                that the band was no longer with Geffen
                Records. The band stated that they would still release new material, but they are unsure of the means,
                whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band
                was signed to the independent label
                Epitaph.

The album "Hurley" was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records.
                The name comes from the character Hugo "Hurley" Reyes from the television show "Lost".
                Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed
                Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is "one of the biggest honors of [his]
                career." Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer
                loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers,
                "going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes." They have
                used many of the popular channels to promote themselves, such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson
                and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers
                solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches
                by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion "The YouTube Invasion"

On
                November 2, 2010,
                Weezer released another studio album called "Death to False Metal". This album was composed of
                newly re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning the band's career.

On October 9,
                2011, the band announced on their website
                that former bassist Mikey Welsh had died.

The band currently consists of the following members:


                * Brian Bell — guitar, backing vocals
 * Rivers Cuomo — vocals, guitar
 * Scott Shriner — bass
                guitar, backing vocals
                (2002-present) (plays on Maladroit and Make Believe)
 * Patrick Wilson — drums

Former
                members:

 * Jason Cropper — Guitar, left the band in September 1993 (believed to have been
                fired by Cuomo, although it is not clear as Cropper
                is forbidden from discussing the issue)
 * Matt Sharp — bass guitar, backing vocals (1992-1997)
                (plays on The Blue Album and Pinkerton)
 * Mikey Welsh — bass guitar, backing vocals (1998-2001)
                (plays on The Green Album) &lt;a

				<content>Wham! (often written WHAM!) was a pop band formed in 1981 from Bushey, England. They were briefly
                known in the United States as Wham! UK due to a naming conflict with another band.

George
                Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met at Bushey
                Meads School in Watford, England. At first, they performed in a short-lived rock and roll band called
                The Executive. They then changed their name and signed with Innervision Records. Soon after a legal
                victory over Innervision, the duo was signed to
                CBS, Columbia Records in the United States and Canada and Epic Records for the rest of the world.

Further
                information: Artist development deal 
Michael took on the majority of roles and responsibilities
                within the band— composer, singer,
                producer, and occasional instrumentalist— but the contribution of Ridgeley as the group's image
                specialist and spokesman was crucial to the band's initial success. Ridgeley convinced a reluctant
                George that Wham! needed to change their
                image and sound frequently, from the leather-clad moody singers of "Bad Boys" and "Young
                Guns (Go For It!)" to the more fashionable pop superstars of "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go."

Still
                teenagers, they promoted
                themselves as hedonistic youngsters, proud to live a carefree life without work or commitment. This was
                reflected in their earliest singles. Such works as "Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do?)" have been
                seen as sarcasm advocating the other point
                of view.

The first record to be released by the band was "Wham Rap!". It was a
                double-A side with a Social Mix and Anti-social Mix. The record was banned for general release in the UK
                due to the profanity in the Anti-social Mix. In
                October 1982, their song "Young Guns (Go For It!)" was issued. The song was an appeal from one
                youthful lad to his friend to not throw his life away so early on marriage. It stalled outside the UK
                Top 40 but then Wham! got lucky when Top Of
                The Pops scheduled them. An important weekly BBC chart show on television, it had to look outside the
                Top 40 to fill a gap created by an act which had pulled out of recording. Nearest to the 40 mark and
                still climbing, Wham! was summoned, and a
                phenomenon immediately began.

The impact of Wham! on the public, especially teenage girls, was
                felt from the moment they finished their debut performance of "Young Guns (Go For It!)" on Top
                Of The Pops. Michael's appearance
                may have helped. He wore espadrilles, a suede jacket slit open, and rolled-up denim jeans. Ridgeley
                stood behind him, flanked by backing dancers D.C. Lee and Shirlie Holliman.

The performance was
                as much one of acting as it was of singing,
                with Michael playing the part of the pleading goodtime lad, and Ridgeley the guy who had been drawn into
                commitment. Afterwards, the song shot into the Top 40 at #24 and peaked at #3 in December. The following
                year (1983), D.C. Lee began her work
                with Paul Weller of The Style Council, and was replaced by Pepsi DeMacque. Holliman and DeMacque would
                later record music as Pepsi and Shirlie.

Wham! followed up "Young Guns (Go For It!)"
                with the reissue "Wham Rap! (Enjoy
                What You Do)", a song about the joys of a leisurely life (the full version of which clocked in at
                almost seven minutes long); "Bad Boys", about a strained relationship between a rebellious
                teenage lad and his worried parents; and
                "Club Tropicana", a satire of the Club 18-30 scene. Each song came with a memorable music
                video.

By the end of 1983, Wham! was rivaling Duran Duran and Culture Club as Britain's
                biggest pop act. Notoriety and column inches
                were duly achieved with their antics of placing a shuttlecock down their shorts, and their first album
                Fantastic reached #1.

Around this time, Ridgeley become conscious of legal problems with their
                initial contract at Innervision. He mounted
                a legal challenge against the record company and its founder Mark Dean, who had initially signed them to
                the label, and George publicly stated they were financially mistreated [citation needed]. While the
                legal battle raged (perhaps to raise
                much-needed funds for the fight), Innervision released a medley of non-single album tracks from
                Fantastic, entitled Club Fantastic Megamix. Wham! publicly denounced the move, and urged fans not to buy
                it. After all the legal wrangling, Innervision
                admitted there were royalty discrepancies with Wham!'s contract, leading to the bankruptcy and
                dissolution of Innervision.

Driven by Ridgeley, the duo changed their image, and Wham! returned
                in May 1984 with an updated, cutting-edge pop
                image quickly copied by other pop bands. Andrew changed the band's look from "moody in leather
                jackets" to smiles and fashionable clothing, with an aim to promote themselves more as sex symbols
                rather than spokespeople for a
                disaffected generation.

Fittingly enough, these changes propelled the next single (a pop
                standard) to the top of the charts around the world. Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go, a song Michael wrote
                from a note left to him in his hotel room one
                night by Ridgeley. The note was mistakenly written by Ridgeley as "don't forget to wake me up
                up before you go go, George". Since he accidentally wrote the word "up" twice, Ridgeley
                decided to compound the error and write
                "go" twice. It became their first UK #1 and rose to the top in the USA), capped by a memorable
                video of the duo, plus the ubiquitous Pepsi and Shirlie, wearing Katharine Hamnett T-shirts with the
                slogans CHOOSE LIFE and GO
                GO.

These t-shirts became essential fashion items as Hamnett wrote herself into the pop culture
                lexicon, having simultaneously designed the FRANKIE SAY t-shirts for Frankie Goes to Hollywood.

Although
                some critics felt that Wham!
                represented bubblegum pop[citation needed], many were starting to appreciate Michael's proven
                ability as a songwriter and capable vocalist. (The following year, he would win the Ivor Novello Award
                for songwriting.) However, at the same time they
                bemoaned the status of Ridgeley, who had started to "play" a guitar during live shows (never
                on any recordings) but whose overall contribution was deemed to be lightweight[citation needed].

With
                some bizarre contradiction, the next
                single "Careless Whisper" was issued as a George Michael solo piece, yet unlike any Wham!
                single since "Wham Rap!," it was co-written by Ridgeley. The song quickly reached #1. In the
                autumn of 1984, Wham! came back as a duo with
                "Freedom", another chart-topper. In November, they released their second album, Make It Big,
                which coasted to #1 on the album charts. The band set off on another arena tour at the end of '84,
                and George told Smash Hits magazine at the
                time that he had written a song called "Stephen." The song had been composed for a friend who
                was struggling to cope with bereavment. While this song is still unreleased, those that were at the
                recording sessions decsribe it as a heartfelt
                story of the loss of a loved one[citation needed].

George contributed to the Band Aid project,
                with Michael providing vocals as the song usurped their own Christmas release, "Last Christmas"/"Everything
                She Wants", the
                former of which featured a video set in a ski resort.

The single became the highest-selling
                single ever to peak at #2 in the UK charts. As such, Wham! donated all their royalties to the Ethiopian
                famine appeal to coincide with the
                fundraising intentions of Band Aid, the song which beat them to the top spot. Band Aid's success
                meant that Michael had been at #1 within three different entities in 1984—as a solo artist, half of a
                duo, and part of a charity
                ensemble.

Michael desired to create music targeted to a more sophisticated audience than the
                duo's primarily teenage fanbase. Therefore, Michael and Ridgeley announced the breakup of Wham! in
                the spring of 1986, destined to take place
                after a farewell single and album, along with a historic grand finale concert at Wembley Stadium on June
                28, 1986, called The Final. British pop group Five Star declined George's invitation to be the
                supporting act, saying they needed to
                concentrate on their own career at the time. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Wham%21"&gt;Read

				<content>Jahseh Dwayne Onfroy (born January 23, 1998), better known by his stage name XXXTentacion, is an
                American rapper from Lauderhill, Florida. Onfroy is known for his versatility with his music, which
                ranges from aggressive, punk rock-inspired
                hip hop, to somber and slower R&amp;B style songs, to even heavy metal. His music is known for the lofi
                sound quality of his vocals and songs, which normally are distorted and unmastered. His vocal style
                ranges from singing, rapping, and screaming.
                Onfroy is also known for his violent outbursts in public life, with numerous arrests related to assault,
                robbery, and weapon possession. 

Onfroy's most popular song to-date is Look at Me, which
                was originally released in 2016 and
                re-released in 2017, and peaked at number 42 on US Billboard Hot 100. The single helped him gain more
                popularity in early 2017 due to accusations of Canadian rapper Drake using a similar rap flow in his
                then unreleased song, now released under the
                name "KMT", that he previewed at a concert in Amsterdam featuring British rapper Giggs.

In
                July 2016, Onfroy was arrested and charged with robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. After posting
                bail in early October of the same
                year, while awaiting trial, Onfroy was arrested again later that month on charges of false imprisonment,
                witness tampering, and aggravated battery of a pregnant victim. Onfroy was released from jail on bail on
                March 26, 2017.

Onfroy
                announced his debut studio album, 17 on July 30, 2017. The album released on August 25, 2017. It
                features 11 tracks and includes the lead single Revenge. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/xxxtentacion"&gt;Read

					<content>Barter 6 is a mixtape by American rapper Young Thug. It was released on April 16, 2015, by 300

                    peaked at 22 on the US charts.
The album was
                    initially titled Carter 6, in continuation of the naming sequence of Lil Wayne's successful Tha
                    Carter album series. This created controversy, as Wayne's scheduled album Tha Carter V was
                    repeatedly delayed amid a dispute between himself and
                    Cash Money Records, who had reportedly refused to release the album. Wayne subsequently became
                    involved in legal proceedings against Cash Money and publicly criticized the label's owner (and
                    Thug's mentor) Birdman, as well as responding
                    negatively to Thug's decision to name the album after him. Despite this, Thug claimed that he
                    was not trying to be disrespectful, and that Wayne was his "idol". &lt;a

				<content>Jeffery Williams, better known by his stage name Young Thug, and was briefly known as "Jeffery",
                is an American rapper from Atlanta, Georgia who is signed to Gucci Mane's 1017 Brick Squad Records,
                Asylum Records and Atlantic

                reception. He has collaborated with artists such as Gucci Mane, Young Scooter, Rich Homie Quan and Waka
                Flocka Flame.

Thug was born amongst
                the masses eliminating any doubt that he wouldn’t be special. The second youngest child of 11 children
                developed a skill for standing out amongst many, early. Young Thug moved to Jonesboro, an impoverished
                suburb of Georgia where his lifestyle was
                engrossed by the crime, drug addiction and violence that surrounded him. It was there that he developed
                an insatiable appetite to succeed his current situation. After discovering and acknowledging his talent
                and creativity for music in 2010, Thug
                started a new hustle that would soon mature as one of the most promising music careers in the South.
                

Eyeballing the throne of Hip hop royalty, Young Thug began to create a sound and style that
                would inevitably place him on top. Young Thug’s
                catchy verses and raw lyrical talent distinguished noise from art, clearly being the latter his
                creations are the best that remain of Southern hip hop. He is the embodiment of the evolution of
                Southern hip-hop. Young Thug is the representative for a
                generation that doesn't see hip-hop as a hobby but a lifestyle. Keeping true to himself, his art,
                and his home Young Thug will stand alone as the one true savior of the Southern movement.

                Young Thug aka The Demon Child is
                hardcore/horrorcore rapper/beatmaker from Central France. Often collaborated with Lil Prod. Also he made
                2 albums under the alias Da Mystic Terror, in these 2 albums he changed his voice to make it sounds like
                it's an other person
                rapping.

Despite
                achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called "the quintessential critics'

                repertoire of cover songs both in live
                performance and on record.

Formation and Early History: 1984–1985

Ira Kaplan and
                Georgia Hubley, a husband/wife duo, formed the band in 1984. They chose the name "Yo La Tengo"
                (Spanish for "I've got it!") in
                an effort to avoid any connotations in English. The name came from a baseball anecdote. During the 1962
                season, New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and Venezuelan shortstop Elio Chacón found
                themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn
                went for a catch, he would scream, "I got it! I got it!" only to run into Chacón, who spoke
                only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, "¡Yo la tengo! ¡Yo la tengo!" instead. In a later game,
                Ashburn happily saw Chacón backing off. He
                relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder Frank Thomas,
                who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words "¡Yo la
                tengo! as a way to avoid outfield collisions.
                After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, "What the heck is a Yellow Tango?".

They
                placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as The Soft
                Boys, Mission of Burma, and Arthur Lee's
                Love. The group's debut recording was a 7" single entitled "The River of Water"
                backed with a cover of Arthur Lee's "A House Is Not a Motel" released in late 1985 with
                Dave Schramm on lead guitar and Dave Rick on
                bass. After recording "Private Doberman" for inclusion on a Coyote Records compilation
                entitled Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood, Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis,
                the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk
                bands DMZ and Lyres, who was also a member of Brooklyn garage rock band The A-Bones throughout his
                tenure.

Early Releases: 1986–1989

In 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, Ride
                the Tiger on Coyote Records. Produced by former
                Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album "marked
                Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential" according to reviewer Mark Deming. Kaplan was credited
                as "naive guitar" on the
                sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on City Slang Records, went so far as
                to say "Dave's guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record."

Schramm
                and Lewis left the band after the
                album's release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski
                joining to play bass. The group's next album New Wave Hot Dogs (1987) sold poorly, but in the words
                of Mark Deming, "was a quantum leap
                over the sound of their debut."

The release of President Yo La Tengo in 1989 did much to
                establish the band's reputation among rock critics including Robert Christgau who praised the
                "mysterioso guitar hook" in the first
                song. Produced by Gene Holder of The dB's, the album was the band's last release on Coyote.
                Despite the positive reception of the album, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long
                after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a
                duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows. Kaplan, though typically a pragmatist, started carrying
                a bug trapped in amber in his pocket for luck.

Bar/None and Alias Records: 1990–1992

Yo
                La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in
                1990 to record Fakebook, an album of mostly acoustic tunes, including covers of Cat Stevens, Gene Clark,
                The Kinks, Daniel Johnston, among others, with five original songs by the band themselves. Again
                produced by Gene Holder, the album's folk
                sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was "just me
                and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller" who played guitar and
                double bass on the album,
                respectively.

In 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with Daniel Johnston
                on the song "Speeding Motorcycle" which was released as a single. The band also released a 7"
                single on Bar/None Records with the
                song "Walking Away from You" backed with a cover of Beat Happening's "Cast a Shadow."
                Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The That Is Yo La Tengo EP released later that year
                included some tracks that would
                end up on the group's next LP.

After the release of That Is Yo La Tengo, James McNew began
                playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to
                McNew,
“I originally signed on as a
                fill-in for a short US tour, and a 4-week summer tour of Europe with Eleventh Dream Day. One night after
                a show in Munster, I was to look after our box of merchandise while Ira and Georgia went gallovanting
                through the town, meeting their policemen.
                Needless to say, during our soundcheck in Hamburg the next day, it suddenly dawned on me that I had left
                the box filled with copies of this EP back at the club in Munster. Oh man, was I in trouble... Sure...
                blame it on the rookie.”
The band
                recorded May I Sing with Me in Boston with Holder producing and Lou Giordano engineering. The album was
                released on Alias Records in 1992. Two of the album's eleven songs ("Swing for Life" and
                "Five-Cornered Drone") were
                carried over from the That Is Yo La Tengo EP and feature Holder on bass. The Upside-Down EP was released
                on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band's releases on Alias.

Early Matador
                period: 1993–2000

In 1993, Yo La
                Tengo began their partnership with Matador Records, releasing a 7" and CD5 of the song "Shaker"
                which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993's Painful was also
                the beginning of the band's
                fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent
                albums. Painful is the first Yo La Tengo to feature James McNew on every song; Rob Sheffield, writing
                for Rolling Stone remarked that McNew
                "became an essential part of the sound on Painful, the 1993 album that kept every promise Yo La
                Tengo ever made and blew their previous highlights away." Critical reaction was quite positive,
                with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling it
                "a subtly addicting album." Robert Christgau also praised the group once again, writing in his
                review that Yo La Tengo is "always friendly. This is not the forbidding experimentation of an
                aspiring vanguard. This is the fooling around
                of folks who like to go out on Saturday night and make some noise--and then go home humming it."
                The band released Electr-O-Pura in 1995 to similar acclaim. For the first time, all songs were credited
                to the band as a whole rather than
                individual members; this became the norm for all future releases.

The band's 1997 LP I Can
                Hear the Heart Beating as One synthesized the group's eclectic combination of folk, punk rock,
                shoegazing, long instrumental noise-jams, and
                electronic music into a sprawling, multi-faceted style. Critical reaction was extremely positive;
                Pitchfork Media awarded the album a 9.7 out of 10 and reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it was
                "arguably Yo La Tengo's finest and
                most coherent album to date." Kaplan recalled a turning point in the band's musical
                progression:
“I think after Electr–O-Pura we’ve had a direction of trying not to worry too hard
                about what the next album is going to sound like.
                Everything we’ve ever played on we just do whatever seems right at the moment, we just write a bunch of
                songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right.”
With their critical
                reputation higher than ever before, the band
                toured extensively and their fan base continued to grow. In 1998, they collaborated with Jad Fair and
                released the album Strange But True to mixed reviews. The band entered the studio again in late 1999 to
                record their ninth LP. And Then Nothing
                Turned Itself Inside-Out was released in February 2000 to a warm reception.

Continued Acclaim
                and Soundtrack Work: 2001–Present

In 2001, Yo La Tengo recorded an instrumental score for eight
                short undersea documentaries by Jean
                Painlevé, entitled The Sounds of the Sounds of Science. The program debuted at the San Francisco Film
                Festival and has been performed live approximately twelve times. The band also released an EP with
                covers of Sun Ra's "Nuclear War"
                in late 2002.

The band's tenth LP, Summer Sun, was released in 2003. Although the album
                received generally favorable reviews, some critics found the album's quiet atmosphere "underwhelming."
                Others criticized the band for
                a perceived lack of invention. When asked about the album's quiet nature, Kaplan stated,
“We
                made a decision at the last second just to leave the loud songs off. We were looking at the material we
                recorded and just trying to put out the best
                record that we could. At a certain point, we just thought it seemed right to put out the quiet ones. I've
                been aware that there's been some surprise about that and people saying it's even quieter than
                the last record, which has sort of
                taken me by surprise."
Yo La Tengo collaborated with Yoko Ono on the 2003 charity album Wig in
                a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch in support of the Harvey Milk High School.
                The band put together their first
                "best of" compilation entitled Prisoners of Love: A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent
                Songs: 1985–2003 which was released in 2005. They composed scores for four more films: 2005's
                Junebug and Game 6, and 2006's Shortbus and
                Old Joy. Their scores for these four films were collected on the 2008 compilation They Shoot, We Score.

Their
                eleventh LP, I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass, was released in 2006 to universal acclaim.
                Informed by their
                soundtrack work, the arrangements included more strings and horns than any of the band's previous
                albums. Kaplan told an interviewer: "I think we gained an element of comfort with using that kind
                of instrumentation, and it became something
                we could draw on for our other songs." In addition, the album was book-ended with two guitar jams
                lasting over ten minutes each.

In 2006, the band released Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the
                Classics, a compilation of their live impromptu
                cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU. As part of the station's
                annual fundraising marathon, listeners who call in to pledge money to the station may request a favorite
                which the band will then perform on the
                spot. In late 2007, the band began performing acoustically for "The Freewheelin' Yo La Tengo"
                tour. Audiences were encouraged to request songs and ask questions which, Kaplan stated, the band tried
                to answer "in a strategic manner
                so that the answers to the questions will lead to the next song."
In March 2008, Yo La Tengo
                performed under the alias "Condo Fucks" at Brooklyn's Magnetic Field. As Condo Fucks, the
                band released an album of cover songs,
                Fuckbook, on Matador in March, 2009. On June 4, Matador announced a new Yo La Tengo album called Popular
                Songs. Yo La Tengo is also contributing to a tribute album for New Zealand rock and roll musician Chris
                Knox who suffered a stroke in June 2009.
                All proceeds from the album will go towards Knox's recovery. &lt;a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Yo+La+Tengo"&gt;Read

					<content>Tres Hombres is the third album by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 1973. It proved to

                    the single "La Grange" hit 41 on the singles chart.
                    The name means "Three Men" in Spanish, referring to the three members of the band. In 2003, the
                    album was ranked number 498 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.
                    During the height of ZZ Tops' success in the early
                    1980s an inferior "digitally remixed" version of the recording replaced the original 1973 analog
                    mix. The remix version was used on all early CD copies and was the only version available for over
                    20 years. A remastered and expanded edition of the
                    album was released on February 28, 2006, which contains three bonus live tracks. The 2006 edition is
                    the first CD version to use the original 1973 mix.

				<content>ZZ Top is an American blues rock band, formed in 1969 in Houston, Texas. The band members are Billy
                Gibbons (vocals and guitar), Dusty Hill (bass guitar and vocals), and Frank Beard (drums). They hold the
                distinction of being one of the few
                rock bands still comprised of its original members for over 40 years, and until 2006, with the same
                manager/producer, Bill Ham.

They reached the peak of their commercial success in the 1970s and
                1980s, scoring many hit songs during that era;
                but they remain together today and are still touring and releasing albums. ZZ Top was inducted into the
                Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 15, 2004. Summarizing their music, Cub Koda wrote, "As genuine
                roots musicians, they have few peers;
                Gibbons is one of America's finest blues guitarists working in the arena rock idiom ... while Hill
                and Beard provide the ultimate rhythm section support."[1] Their song lyrics often feature sexual
                innuendo and humor.

Nearly as
                well-known as their music is the group's appearance: Gibbons and Hill are always pictured wearing
                sunglasses (a nod to their 1979 song "Cheap Sunglasses"), similar (if not matching) clothing,
                and their trademark chest-length beards,
                while Beard sports a mustache but not a beard. In 1984, the Gillette Company reportedly offered Gibbons
                and Hill US$1 million apiece to shave their beards for a television commercial, but they declined.

The
                origin of the band's name was
                not officially known for many years. Some theories included: the two brands of rolling paper, Zig-Zag
                and Top; a tribute to blues legend Z. Z. Hill; Z-shaped barn-door braces Gibbons once saw at a farm;
                and/or Billy Gibbons seeing the two words
                running together on a dilapidated bill board. The real origin, as told by Billy Gibbons and also
                recorded in his new book (Rock + Roll Gearhead), is derived from the name of blues master B.B. King.
                They wanted to call themselves Z.Z. King but sounded
                too similar to their blues legend hero. They figured that "King" was at the "top" so
                thus settled on ZZ Top.

The men who would form ZZ Top had played in several different
                Texas-based groups (including the Moving
                Sidewalks, The Cellar Dwellers, The Hustlers, The Warlocks and American Blues) before joining forces in
                late 1969.

They toured almost continually for several years, but first gained wide acclaim with
                their third album, Tres Hombres (1973).
                It contained the classic song "La Grange", referencing the bordello that is the subject of the
                musical The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.

The band continued touring, recording, and
                releasing albums until 1977, when they took an
                extended hiatus. Their long-time manager/producer/image maker Bill Ham used this time to negotiate a
                deal that allowed the band to keep control of their previous recordings, which would be distributed by
                their new label, Warner Brothers. They
                reunited two and a half years later in order to start recording under that new Warner Brothers contract.
                Unbeknown to the other, both Hill and Gibbons had grown the chest-length beards that quickly became a
                part of their "wildman"
                image.

They reached new heights of popularity with the 1983 album Eliminator, boosted to
                prominence by memorable music videos for the tracks "Gimme All Your Lovin'", "Legs"
                and "Sharp-Dressed Man" each of
                which featured a small bright red Ford '34 3 window hotrod called The Eliminator and a trio of
                mysterious, beautiful women who travel around helping various people. The album also featured a
                distinctive synthesizer-laced sound--a rarity in the
                blues rock genre--which added a modern, new wave edge to the music, and helped the album become
                successful. Eliminator remains their most successful album to date.

Their next album,
                Afterburner, mostly featured the same blend of
                synthesizers, sequencers and blues rock. Some critics have expressed frustration at this approach. But
                on subsequent albums, less and less synth- and synchronizer-influenced music is heard. An occasional
                song with those elements and instruments is
                included on recent albums as a nod to their past.

In 1994, ZZ Top signed a five-disc deal with
                RCA Record. Many fans (or, as they refer to themselves, "fanzz") feel that the recordings of
                this era are as artistically strong as the
                earlier London and Warner Brothers recordings, but have expressed disappointment with RCA's
                promotion of these releases. On several occasions Billy Gibbons was overheard refering to the execs at
                RCA as "a bunch of cock suckers".
                

In July 2000, while on tour in Europe, Hill was diagnosed with Hepatitis C, which forced the
                cancellation of several dates in that tour. Hill has since made a remarkable recovery, joking, "You
                just can't keep down ZZ
                Top!"

In 2003, a comprehensive collection of recordings from the London and Warner Brother
                years entitled "Chrome, Smoke &amp; BBQ" was released.



As of 2006, it is
                reported that ZZ Top is recording their
                15th studio album.
